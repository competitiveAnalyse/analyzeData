__label__ProductQuality "DO NOT BUY ""Razer Man O War 7.1 Wireless"" HEADPHONES. Bought my son a set for his birthday and in under 2 years (in Australia) the plastic head band snapped while he was putting it on his head. Razer said it only has 1 year warranty, so too bad so sad. No headphones (costing well over $200) should fracture ever, let alone in under 2 years. You can see in the photos that the headphones were treated very well as well. POOR QUALITY PRODUCT, CRAP CUSTOMER SERVICE, DON'T BUY RAZER! *** Notice the friendly email from Razer below, got that from Razer Customer Service when I lodged the issue, they said only 1 year warranty; I asked the issue to be escalated, with they said they would, then I never heard back from them again after numerous emails over a number of weeks ***"
__label__QualityOfService "Refused to honor warranty, when the warranty is still in effect, according to their website. I signed up for the warranty when I received the product, and since it was a gift I don't have proof of purchase anymore(was included in warranty registration) and I can't contact that person anymore, it's not a valid warranty."
__label__ProductQuality "My MSI Z170A Motherboard kept clocking my CPU (i7 6700K) at 800MHz. I tried a number of fixes (Over clocking, updating BIOS, setting Slow_Mo switch on/off, using Intel software, CPUz and so on) and nothing really worked."
__label__ProductQuality __label__QualityOfService "Second faulty graphics card in a year, first one got replaced by amazon. Tried to contact msi and sent 3 emails to their support centre with no reply. Amazon have now refunded the item as I've had no luck with msi. Avoid unless you want faulty equipment and No support. Great customer service from Amazon is the only saving grace to this situation."
__label__QualityOfService "Trash company trash service, only makes crappy robotic copy paste replies to their customers to contact their crappy customer service line where they dont even answer. Dont bother emailing feedback@razer(dot)com because they wont answer nor care nor give a crap. They only make these types of copy paste replies to boost their trustpilot scores which is shady and fraudulent. Dont give them any service and dont ever buy from razer again. Asus, released a new phone better than the razer phone 1 and 2 combined called the asus rog phone, turtle beach and shure make the best when it comes to sound and microphones. logitech gaming equipment never breaks or has issues.  Its time to run greedy, garbage, fraudulent companies like razer to the ground. They do nothing but care about their own money and give 0 care for the customer.   The end of the line for me to stop buying from razer was when I ( a customer for several years who had purchased thousands of dollars from razer products before, because I actually thought they where decent, Stupid me.) was when I asked for a promo code they had about a few weeks ago that had recently expired. I explained that I would be more than inclined to buy several of their products if they allowed me to have that simple deal once again and generate me a personal promo code. Which they declined making the excuse that the promo code was for ""marketing purposes"" and could not be re made. to which I closed the chat with their useless representative, I contacted asus and simply asked for a PROMO CODE nothing else, and they gave me a MUCH better deal, the friendly and outstanding customer service rep from asus, who gave me an incredible deal, (Much better than what I had requested razer.) Who gave me more than 700$ in savings from their outstanding promo code.   I feel safe to say that I will never purchase another product from razer again, they have lost a loyal customer who has been there for them for years, and they have completely lost any and all of my business with them.  I recommend you switch companies as well. and forget about razer, and let them die in their own corporate greed."
__label__ProductQuality "Every Razer product I have seen/used has malfunctioned in some way. I have personally spent hundreds on Razer products, my Razer Blade Stealth has had a BSoD every single day since I got it. Several of my friends have a Razer mouse or keyboard that freeze or bug out. I honestly can't recommend Razer to anyone."
__label__ProductQuality "My DeathAdder Chroma had its middle mouse button stop working. Long story short within a few days they gave me the full amount of store credit (more than I originally paid for the mouse) to buy the DeathAdder Elite, which was really nice of them.  Yeah they may have some quality issues, but their design work is top notch. I currently own a DeathAdder Elite (previously the Chroma, and 3.5g before that), and BlackWidow v2, and they're great to use. It'd be nice to see more work done on Synapse, though it's still very convenient as a central hub to setup different mouse+kb settings across different games."
__label__QualityOfService "Atrocious. Bought a laptop that was falsely advertised got a totally different product and they are refusing to do anything and being rude to me at the same time"
__label__ProductQuality __label__QualityOfService "Purchased the quartz (pink) version of the Blackwidow keyboard alongside the matching mouse and mousepad - over $200.  Within 1 week the keyboard began registering double/triple keystrokes. Reviews online reported the same experience. Received a replacement keyboard and it exhibited the exact same problem out of the box.  Asked Razer for a refund on the keyboard as the product itself is obviously entirely defective. I wasn't interested in receiving yet another replacement keyboard that, according to my own experience and others, has a high chance of developing this problem within a week.  They refused as it had been 30 days since the purchase was made. Razer refuses to stand behind their design mistakes and make things right."
__label__ProductQuality "I’ve owned 2 Razer laptops. One (Blade 2014) had its battery die within 2 years of usage and is unusable even if connected to power. The second one (stealth 2017) has a constant power problem with the power cord and sometimes decides not to charge, besides just becoming stuck after shutdown with the fans and keyboard on, can’t force shut down."
__label__QualityOfService "Writing this whilst waiting for a response from Asus UK and their EU RMA division regarding a high-end (£500 new) motherboard that has gone faulty within 3-year warranty (18 months in),  but have to echo the one-star comments made by other with regards to the REALLY poor customer service from this company.  I have commenced the RMA process for an expensive motherboard with their Czech division and have received a SECOND-HAND board to replace my faulty item, which is either faulty itself, or has not been refurbished to a very high standard and has clearly had some very heavy use in the past.  The components on their replacement board look tired and worn,  there are traces of dust and 'fluff' in key components and the condition of the replacement board just isn't acceptable.  I cannot understand how a Global Tech' company producing such expensive and leading-edge goods can get away with colourful warranty advertising etc. on their original product packaging, but yet treat customers so badly when there is a genuine component failure.  Buy their products with caution and do not be assured by multi-year warranty when the reality of the RMA process can give you a poor quality replacement (which I will not be using with my expensive CPU !!).  I personally won't buy Asus again."
__label__ProductQuality __label__QualityOfService "I have owned 2 mice so far and both have been disappointing due to poor ergonomics and manufacturing quality. Most recently I am sending my Deathadder Elite in for RMA in Singapore and have been advised that I have to post it to the warehouse, even though their warehouse is less than 40 minutes away. It will cost me $10 to have it delivered in 3 days and over 40 minutes dealing with SingPost.   The RMA email states that it can take Razer 3 days to process then return via mail and is likely to take a further 3 days (minimum) to be delivered. That is around 9 days without a mouse (I don't have a spare). I could save 6 days by simply delivering it myself.  I've RMA'd things with other manufacturers before and they have taken time but they have always organised a courier or a direct drop off location to help speed the process.   Other brands have better quality products at lower prices. Won't be buying Razer next time.  EDIT: Was contacted by Razer regarding this review and asked to contact them. The email address they supply is no longer current and a week has passed with no contact from Razer. Their support gets worse and worse."
__label__ProductQuality "Razer is a terrible company that makes terrible devices. I am a technician and I have worked on a few of them. I have had several that have exhibited burnt and charred components on the circuit board. One of which, happened in my shop. If I had not have been there when it happened, there is a good possibility that it would have started a fire. Most of their devices are affected by defects, and they should not be available for purchase due to the fire hazard."
__label__QualityOfService "is a scam company that sends me a mouse that lasted me less than a year and now will not replace it. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY PERIOD. Products that last about a year and will do nothing but give you a discount code for a new one for you to spend more of your money on. Was also dropped by agent John O. 2 times and wasted my time with things I already said I tried to fix my issues. thank you so much for the terrible experience."
__label__QualityOfService "Painfully slow ordering process. If you live in the EU I would avoid ordering through their website. Best thing they could do would be to let Amazon take over all EU distribution.   24 hours to acknowledge an order... 24 hours to process 5 days to 'prepare' 3-5 days waiting for the item to arrive from Hong Kong. These are buisness days aswell so it's practically 2 weeks to receive anything, which is shockingly slow, it just doesn't work when anywhere else is 1 day delivery.  There's no automated way to cancel either so you're stuck waiting wishing you just ordered from somewhere else."
__label__ProductQuality "i have had a great time with Razer in the past. my mouse, perfect. i have had this mouse and 0 problems. i have 2 headsets too, both with minor issues, but only after a year n a half - 2 years of using. BUT, i just got the Razer nari, and, man o man, did they screw the pooch on this one. I've tried everything to get this headset to work, but the microphone is dead, after 2 days. i did everything to solve this issue, and no result. i can only blow into the mi, but not speak, and i hate it. i would've loved this headset, but the fact that i wanted a Bluetooth microphone, and got a hunk of junk, i think i'll go back to other products"
__label__QualityOfService "I have contacted their support multiple times, but I never gotten an answer that helped."
__label__ProductQuality "Got an MSI GE62 6QC at the end of 2015, caught MSI gimping it's performance through shady and undocumented changes in BIOS/EC updates along with multiple other problems. After 3 RMAs they upgraded me to a GE62VR 7RF which has many of the same issues and shows signs of hardware failure. MSI refuse to do anything."
__label__QualityOfService "Razer is literally the most money seeking, trash, dirtbag, scamming company. their products are trash and you spend 150 dollars on a bloody potato that i could buy at a dollar store"
