__label__QualityOfService "Purchased a mouse via their store on 23rd September. They invoiced to my UK address in Euro, so I paid via paypal with Euro. Now they claim they cannot ship because the currency does not match my shipping destination.   I have asked them to either ship or refund but they are ignoring my emails as of Friday 28th September.  This is theft right? Taking money, then not supplying the goods?   I can prove all of this with emails if required to verify this review or whatever.  Will never purchase a Razer product again that's for sure.  (Edit) I finally received a reply and a UK code to get my mouse so this was resolved in the end, but taking a customer's money and going full silent for a week is still poor form and I still wonder what would have happened if I hadn't chased the issue. Review changed from 1 star to 2."
__label__ProductQuality "I bought the Razer Man'O War headset.  With that first sentence you probably know where I'm going with this.  Two months in the head cushion broke off. Two years in the headset completely snapped in half.  What's worse is that Razer knows this is a known issue with the product.  That's why they built a new one without these horrible problems."
__label__QualityOfService "They refused to return it past warranty even though they know this problem existed before the product was even rolled out.    No recalls were made. No efforts were made to reach out to customers. And instead of simply replacing my headset they only wanted to give a $20 discount.  I'm sorry but that is unacceptable.  Michelle from Razer Support headed this up.  20$ discount is a complete lack of respect for someone who easily spends thousands in Razer products.  Officially done with them due to their poor Support.  Once my other Razer products expire I'm moving to Logitech.  Also pursuing legal action due to similar experiences across multiple Razer products.  Jared"
__label__ProductQuality __label__QualityOfService "My God, where do I start with this utterly abysmal company? In a nutshell here's a breakdown: 1. Asus Laptop Hybrid died on me. I work in tech, tried to fix but nothing would work.  2. Contacted Asus &amp; 3rd party repair company collected. My computer was in brand new condition. 3. Two weeks later it arrives back to me complete with damage to the outer shell, the track pad &amp; lots of dirt &amp; scratches. 4. Still wouldn't work properly so contacted Asus to complain. 5. Long story short, a year went by for me fighting this damn company tooth &amp; claw for damages &amp; demanding a new replacement but they always made excuses not to compensate me due their 3rd party repairs damage to my computer being MY fault &amp; they refuse to take responsibility. 6. I get involved Trading Standards, Ombudsman &amp; other legal bodies, even my MP (who you'll know from the telly), &amp; ALL take my side &amp; say Asus is breaching its terms &amp; should either compensate or replace. Yet none of them could help as it would involve a long legal battle for me.  I went sadly to my local Currys store to try get a new computer &amp; was asked by manager there what was wrong. I told him. He said where did I buy it from? I said his store. He got his area manager to hear the story. They went away &amp; came back 10 mins later &amp; said even though the returns receipt to them was 9months out, they wanted to be 'the good guys for a change' so proceeded to take the Asus off me &amp; said 'go get a new one to the same value with our compliments!!  WHAT A STAR COMPANY CURRYS IS  ðŸ¤© Total respect for them now.  As for Asus (or should that be ANUS ðŸ˜‚), I HAVE TOLD EVERYONE WHO'LL LISTEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA &amp; PERSONAL FRIENDS &amp; THOSE I SEE WANTING TO BUY A COMPUTER I SEE IN A STORE, TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS DREADFUL, ABYSMAL, CONNING, CONNIVING, CRAFTY, DAMN RIGHT CRIMINAL COMPANY.  I will NEVER buy from, nor recommend Asus to anyone. Check out all the other reviews, ALL ONE STAR. NOW WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THEM?"
__label__QualityOfService "Horrendous customer service, my Â£600 graphics card failed 2 years 9 months into the 3 year warranty, I sent it back, had it back, it worked for 3 months, broke again with the same fault and they refused to help. Do not buy from MSI, go for zotac with their 5 year warranty and excellent customer service. You've been warned."
__label__ProductQuality "I can't speak for others but my experience with this laptop has been a horror story. Problem after problem. The ""awesome"" LED keyboard stopped responding. I got a few bluescreens (which randomly just happen). When i'm typing the computer takes a mind of it's own sometimes and randomly backspaces and has a key ""stick"" and type 10-20 of the character, all the time. The memory cache always has to reload and the cache on the desktop won't even load anymore (dead icons). And to top it all off, the hinge on the left side broke, as I was closing my lid the other day. Now I can't even close it without significant effort. There are more issues but these just the ""major"" ones off the top of my head."
__label__ProductQuality "I got the MSI GE63VR-7RF on Feb-2018 and its been about 6 months and the fans of the laptop has died with no reason and the temperature of laptop its insane high like 90c+ i cant even put my fingers on the keyboard and there is nothing written to Warranty to get it fixed! MSI has poor long time quality!   The laptop itself is very good i like the keyboard speakers and everything but the thermals is the main thing in any laptop and it GETS burning HOT with GTX1070 and goes like hell 90c+ temp, the performance goes to crap and u have a worthless laptop!  never Buying MSI again! I have used HP GAMING(3years) and DELL for (1.5 years) both had no problem for years but MSI products don't last a year even!!"
__label__ProductQuality __label__QualityOfService "Do not buy MSI if you want a company that stands behind it's products. Laptop died one day after warranty period ended. MSI customer support was unwilling to help me in anyway. All they could offer me was for me to pay to ship it in, and for me to pay for parts and labor. I spent well over 1500 for this laptop and for the motherboard to die two years into ownership is unacceptable. On top of that for a company to have such poor customer support after the fact of product failure is even more unacceptable."
__label__QualityOfService "I rather get fked by a big trumpet dry too no lubrication while patrick star is fked by spongebob square Dic then buy this piece of crap worthless product called a msi computer their customer support sucks dic so bad that i needed physiatrist too stop me from killing myself. A drunk, drug addict hobo could make a better product and company then this. Don't buy anything from this worthless company. GO TO HELL!!"
__label__ProductQuality "Unfortunately MSI don't have any Linux drivers for the device I purchased which sucks, I originally bought it for a Windows PC, the motherboard is a struggle to run on Linux.  Not to mention participating in anti-competitive behaviour with NVIDIA by joining the GPP and completely snubbing AMD."
__label__QualityOfService "Called technical support regarding a motherboard that violently failed. They were a bit lost was lost and gave incorrect information, tried to steer them right but failed (Call center sounded american was friendly). I then called back to customer service this time (not the greatest line quality call center sounded overseas), was on hold, guy picked up and asked me to hold more, they had correct technical info but the man was INCREDIBLY BELLIGERENT he was hostile dismissive and talking/shouting over me the whole time. He claimed to be a supervisor. Incredibly disrespectful service. Also the warranty of all products but laptops is based on date of manufacture not date of sale so if you buy and older product you are SOL. I have been a loyal patron of MSI's products for years spending thousands on components for my self and the systems I build for others choosing their GPU's vs the many other offerings and recommending there products. This has been my first time needing support (a testament to there general quality I have experienced thus far) and it was abysmal. Not sure if I can recommend this company anymore or will choose to supply there products in my future system builds. The customer service is also unable to offer anything but replacement and seems wholly ineffectual at providing good service to maintain customer loyalty in non standard cases. ZOTAC of all companies had much better service! They sent me a replacement + a bunch of free swag payed for shipping both ways and were friendly and responsive. I am in disbelief of how little customer service they could offer me regardless of my x79 board that blew up when installed properly (the only motherboard I have ever had just explode in smoke) possibly taking my expensive CPU and RAM with it to the grave. They couldn't even provide a small reimbursement of any amount to cover the cost of replacing the motherboard, even cooler master which had friendly but terrible service that dragged me along for over a year, was able to credit me though pay pal to provide compensation for their defective cooler.   MSI will no longer be one of my first choices &amp; most recommended hardware manufactures after today's experience."
__label__ProductQuality __label__QualityOfService "They make computers that last for about 1-2 years. After that they start to have issues. After a year and a half with no issues on my computer I had to return it to MSI to be fixed. It took them an entire month to get my computer back to me, which is just terrible. When I tried contacting their support they were some of the most rude people I ever met. So if all you care about is a good computer then this is a good company. I feel that there is more to a company than that though."
__label__QualityOfService "Waited a year for a GT72 2QE laptop to be repaired, it never was, they withheld it from me for months, offered a replacement GT72 6QE, had exactly same fault, wouldn't repair it as I withheld old model from them for same amount of months they did to me. They got it back now, but 12 months later still no Â£1400 laptop. Cowboys, especially that rude Michael in their UK support, Poland. Avoid the company."
__label__QualityOfService "MSI support informed me that they no longer provide support or parts for this 3 year old model.   I will NOT EVER buy another msi product.  Lenovo Thinkpad p50 and p70 series laptops or any of Lenovo future workstation class laptops will be my ONLY options from now on.  Lenovo has 5 year warranties available."
__label__ProductQuality "No way to find the drivers and utilities for an upgraded Win 10 system or even the old ones for windows 8.1 or windows 7. All the download links for legacy machines are no longer available. In my case I'm looking for the latest drivers and utilities for MSI GT70-0NC US."
__label__ProductQuality "I purchased what I thought was a top class Gaming GT72 VR 13 months ago.  Within 6 months there were multiple problems with the system, crashes, lags and random restarts."
__label__QualityOfService "Just absolutly garbage. I bought my MSI steel series notebook and loved it to death. Until one day the fans stopped working (oh and right after the warranty expired too.) So i took it to idk how many shops to get it looked at, I called them first and me living in Maui, they said they can't use a p.o. box and that's all I have. So anyway back to the fans. I finally find a shop to look at it and then a week and a half goes by. Guess whats the problem.....the motherboard is. On top of the 150 dollars I spent having it looked at I now gotta pay msi 70 dollars along with shipping and handling and then the cost to get a new mother board in! Yeah stay the hell away from msi its not worth your time."
