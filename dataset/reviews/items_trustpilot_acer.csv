"dict","Tried hard to order laptop but failed. The first time they cancelled order, didn't tell me and when I phoned couldn't say why or uncancel it. Reluctantly I reordered with different credit card and pretty much the same thing happened. Nothing wrong with credit cards - I checked with card provider! Despite several phone calls and on line complaints, no resolution. Helpful reply today stating order cancelled due to problem with credit card (not true), email all in French!! I view myself lucky that I didn't get the laptop and have to deal with potential problems... Customer service person said he would phone me back tomorrow when he was on holiday it later transpired.

"dict","Amazing how little customer service is available out there.  This company is among the worst from what I have read.  My Acer laptop suddenly started installing Windows 10 updates and froze on 98% for hours.  Now it is useless.  Spent hours reading and trying possible solutions which have not worked.  I tried to contact Acer but the laptop is off warranty so they will not help.  I have no install disk because none was provided.     When will we start a consumer rebellion against all the fraud, misrepresentations and downright lying which pervades every aspect of  our society from the top on down?

"dict","I purchased an ACER SPIN 5 from Costco on July 27th 2018.It cost over $700. After one week I was having issues with the computer wakening out of sleep mode. It simply would not. I contacted customer service and they talked me through a solution which only partially worked. I waited for Costco to get some more in but they did not. Now last week 11/2/18 the SSD stopped working and the laptop would not boot up. I went through the usual procedures with technical support and they finally agreed that the hard drive is dead and that I would need to send it to ACER in Texas for repair. They DO NOT cover the shipping and with the insurance it cost me $45 to send an almost brand new computer to ACER for repair. I protested with them and Costco but got nowhere. THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DO NOT BUY ACER....... I have written to Costco to ask why they did not know about the customer having to pay shipping after the laptop is 90n days old. I am disappointed with ACER &amp; Costco. It is a pity because it seems like it would be a nice machine.","review","english","ACER","Graham Packer","1","2018-11-10T20:44:03.000+00:00","I purchased an ACER SPIN 5 from Costco…","2"

"dict","When my Acer laptop that I had been using for 10 years stopped working I knew that I wanted my new laptop to be an Acer. Unfortunately I have been very disappointed with my purchase. It works. I'm using it now. But it crashes at lot. It fails to do updates. It completely freezes at least once a week. My internet connection is strong. It's definitely the laptop that has the problem and not my connection. I've had this Aspire E 15 for just over a year now and I can no longer close the lid. It lives under a pillow case when I'm not using it to protect it from the dust. One of the hinges is completely bust and trying to move the lid rips the screen cover away from the screen. I was so happy with my previous Acer laptop but am so disappointed with this one. I feel like I should have gone a bit higher than two stars because my previous Acer was so good. But I bought it a long time ago and my new one is nowhere near the standard I expected. Maybe Acer quality has gone downhill over the years. The only reason I was adamant that I wanted another Acer was because my old one felt indestructible. This one has felt flimsy since the day I took it out of the box. As annoying as it was when the hinge completely broke, it didn't come as a great surprise. I had been expecting something to break for a while. I think I might stay away from Acer next time.","review","english","ACER","Mr Jack","1","2018-08-19T12:34:33.000+00:00","My new Acer laptop is nowhere near the quality of my previous Acer.","2"
"dict","I bought the relatively expensive monitor Acer Predator 27"" 4K IPS G-sync and discovered a couple of months later that it had a couple of bright pixels and reported that to the reseller. They asked me for pictures and after I sent them some photos they said It was difficult to see, but to contact Acer support directly.  Their pixel warranty is ≤2 bright subpixels on a 4K monitor, 3 subpixels=1 pixel.  I contacted Acer support Sweden and sent them 3 photos where the broken/bright pixels were clearly visible, it went quiet for a couple of weeks so I sent them a reminder asking how my case was going. Then they answered and wanted some more photos and asked me to mark/indicate the broken pixels on the photos. So I sent them 6 photos (closeups and with the whole monitor) with the pixels marked. Even in the photo where you can see the whole monitor you can see the broken/bright pixel at a distance, and this is on a 27 inch 4K monitor with high ppi.  Now they asked me for better closeups so that they could see each separate pixel, I don't have a good enough camera (I have a iPhone 8 plus) to take such detailed pictures. I thought it would be enough that they could see the bright white dot in the middle of the screen at all my photos (and another one down in the right corner). As I said earlier, it has so high pixel density that it's hard to distinguish individual pixels with the naked eye. But I can easliy see the bright pixels at a distance.  I gave up, I'll keep the bad monitor and buy a new one from a different manufacturer.   I will never buy an Acer product again, because of poor support and that it's apparently normal with bright white pixels on a premium monitor from Acer. I can't recommend them at all to anyone, sadly, because they have some interesting products.","review","english","ACER","Andreas Sjökvist","1","2018-06-14T15:21:25.000+00:00","Pixel warranty, bad support and not a premium product","1"

"dict","I would give them less rating if I can. Years ago I bought a laptop and a monitor and they worked fantastic without any issue and still working. When I thought it is time to buy new things, I bought from them based on that. However, the laptop did not survive more than a month and catastrophically failed. It took too much hassle to fix and came back damaged after repairs. In a the following few months, the monitor failed as well. It seems Acer used to produce good stuff in the past but not anymore. Obviously, they are only capitalizing on their past earned reputation but not the current quality. About the damaged laptop after repairs, I complied but I found their staff rude and arrogant to admit the negligence and fault although I showed it to them after three pretend investigations. But the company did not care. When you have bad quality and people like these, what chance do you have. What it seems it used to be good company and good equipment but now they have new policy, new people and less quality. I would not be surprised if someone of Acer responds to this post to give the impression they care, they had many rounds to show that and the issue was escalated to the highest possible. I appreciate they invest in quality control rather than hiring people to give you no joy and good impression they care or investigate.","review","english","ACER","semt","2","2018-03-20T22:39:45.000+00:00","I would give them less rating if I can","1"
"dict","Purchased an Acer laptop which was defective from the start. Instead of giving me a replacement, they tried to fix the issue multiple times before being able to actually fix it.  In the process, they dented the side panel and then passed it off as a minor issue.  Everyone I contacted from Acer were extremely rude, and unwilling to provide service, and unwilling to take accountability for the damage. I now have a physically damaged 1 month old laptop and have already experience very bad conduct from the Acer employees.  Quite frankly, I would give 0 stars if it was possible  TL;DR: DO NOT EVER BUY AN ACER! You can just set fire to all your cash, if that is what you are after, but do not buy an Acer.","review","english","ACER","GravityCoder","1","2018-01-31T07:11:41.000+00:00","Worst quality products and even worse customer service.","1"
"dict","Their Limited Warranty covers nothing. The hinge on the Stand can't support the weight of the Monitor. The hinge cracked within 6 months. A bit of Plastic holds on to the whole weight of the device, What is Acer thinking. Balancing an Elephant over a Pencil.  If you do buy this, buy a separate mount. When it does come slamming down. Acer won't care or do anything. Better be ready to ship it yourself and pay more than full price for repair...while having a useless 3 year ""warranty"".  The monitor slid off and slammed on top of my desk. Half of the Screen does not work anymore. Called CSR, won't cover their own Design Flaw.  They ruled it as an accident. I did not spill tea, or abuse it any way. Their poorly designed stand cracked under the wright of the Monitor.  Really irritated that it did not last a year. Can't even justify the purchase.  My last monitor was from LG and it withstood 10 years (Stand that cradled the Monitor...no hinge).  Been with Acer since Conception. My first PC from 2003 still works to this day. My latest PC from 2014.  I can attest for their PC...they were built to last. This monitor has a serious design flaw, their poor CSR &amp; warranty is not worth it. Even if the device is quality at an affordable price.  I rather pay extra for good included warranty and actual Customer Service. Check out their Customer Service reviews. Very anti-consumer unlike other rival companies.  From first choice to never again.

"dict","I'm writing this review to prevent others having to go through the stress of dealing with this company. I purchased an Acer tablet and within a couple of weeks the screen had discolouration.  I sent back the tablet and was told it had been deemed as accidental damage therefore they could not fix or exchange it. The tablet was not damaged on the exterior at all and had no signs of being misused.  I sent a number of emails asking them how after 3 weeks this could have happened and had no helpful response just a generic reply.  Fixing the problem will cost more than the tablet is worth! I have never experienced any like this before having purchase tablets/phones in the past, either it was poorly made or already had a fault or weakness when it was sent. I'm disgusted that the company feel they can use this excuse for a product we have had for just a couple of weeks.

"dict","ACER R11 I bought my Acer R11 laptop/notebook from Tesco online (collect in store) in Aug 2017.   I paid only £174 for the basic notebook.  (I added MS Word as the only add-on).   This was indeed a bargain price.   I bought the Acer R11 because my other laptop - also recently bought (last 12 months) is a top-of-the-range-spec DELL XPS13,  (Intel i7 and 20GB RAM) which cost me approx. £2500 (can't remember the exact amount) - expensive, yes but so worth it.  It's lightning fast and can do anything simultaneously with unlimited apps open at a time.      We've just had a 4 week trip to the US - just back  - (do this regularly).  Fact is I am terrified of losing the DELL XPS when travelling (or having it stolen/taken at airports) .......  the DELL has my life in it and is V expensive.    So, I bought the Acer (v cheap) and took it instead to the US (and will use it for future travel),  just for mail, some use of internet, some banking/dollar purchasing, motel reservations, photo processing, kindle reading, facebook etc.   The ACER R11 has been great - and tremendous value for only £174.   For it's limited spec it's been (is) fast enough, well supported by Acer and well equipped.  Only 2 criticisms - 1.  It is heavy for it's small size (solid steel I guess)  -  my DELL - very similar size - is much lighter (aluminium case).  2nd crit of the Acer - NO indication you are in CAPS LOCK ...........   which is infuriating till u r used to it and guard against.    (The DELL has a permanent reminder of the Caps Lock status).   But Overall  -  the ACER R11 is VERY good for it's low price.  I'm delighted with it as spare notebook.","review","english","ACER","chris doubleyou","3","2017-09-29T13:12:19.000+00:00","ACER R11","4"

"dict","I have had a number of Acer products over the years and quite liked them as, apparently, value for money. UNTIL my last acquisition - a Chromebook. Only used a very few times on short trips, it went wrong in that it was impossible to connect the power lead to the internal connector in order to re-charge the battery.  The unit was only 6 months old and barely used.  Acer Customer Services (in UK at least) were TERRIBLE. I will never buy another Acer product.  They first offered to extend the Warranty for another six months. Sounds good? Yes - but they then said the damage was consumer caused! How can a user cause internal damage to a connector unless the connector is crap in the first place? They then said the unit was damaged in transit but would not offer proof and wanted to charge me to get sent a video of the unpacking at their end.  Fortunately I had taken photos of the my packing.  They then withdrew charges of damage but wanted £70.00 to fix the fault (25% of its original cost) or send it back to me for £35.00!  But they also offered to destroy it for FREE!  Nice of them.  I threatened court action for a product faulty under UK consumer law and my supplier MISCO offered to pay my costs for the repair. WELL DONE MISCO.  But of course Acer got away with getting paid to fix a crap design fault internal to the casing (in the UK you can't sue the manufacturer only the company which sold you the product).  So: NO MORE ACER products in my family - EVER.  If a manufacturer can't be bothered to back its own products but just wriggles and argues and makes up (fraudulent) excuses to avoid its responsibilities and to try to gain yet more revenues for itself , then it is not a manufacturer I ever want to deal with.

After a couple of days I checked the order and saw it was in a 'Payment Review' status so I called Acer Sales ""support"" and spoke with agent (Mark - Agent ID 267), who I spoke with previously. He advised that the order was on hold as Acer would not deliver to the DHL service point. I pointed out that was not the advice that had been previously given. The agent then became very adversarial and started talking over me whilst I was trying to speak and completely denied what he had previously said and became quite rude and suggested that I just cancel the order. I get the impression the agent didn't care about my order at all.

The only thing that brought this review up to 3 stars (and not less), was the very genuine effort made by one the customer service employees that followed the case once I was having problems, and ensure the unit was repaired, checked properly and sent back to me.  The warranty on an unit like this (especially at a relatively low price level), they should of just exchanged out for a new unit returned to me so I can continue my business (with minimal interruption), and the old monitor could then be repaired/sold on as a 2nd's unit, and many other electronic companies do.","review","english","ACER","dbreviews","1","2018-11-26T12:42:34.000+00:00","Like pulling teeth_Need to change their warranty policy","3"

QVC were brilliant and refunded my money so I bought exactly the same thing (STUPID ME) from Argos plus a case to keep it safe JUST ONE MONTH LATER and the same fault happened (must be a design fault I guess) Argos eventually offered to supply the new updated version I just had to pay another £45 to get the replacement. Great (or so I Thought) got it home and the damn case wont fit the new tablet so I contacted Acer to see if they would give me a new case after all the problems I have had.

"dict","I bought an Acer tablet just under a year ago and all of a sudden the charger cable kept falling out and it was taking 3 days to charge the tablet. I sent it to Acer who then accused me of misusing it and said that it would cost me £96.26 to repair it. It only cost me £99 to buy in the first place, I`m saying ""only"", it`s a lot of money if you don`t have it. Then if I wanted it back it would cost me £18 to send back.  If I could give no stars for their customer service I would. It`s absolutely shocking, and to be accused of misuse is a joke. Perhaps I used it as a hammer, or a doorstop. I am now going to have a useless tablet returned to me, at my cost, that I can never use unless I pay through the nose to have repaired. I actually knew the blame would be put at my door before I sent it to them. Absolutely s**t service for a product that has cost me so far just over £10 a month to buy, and double that if I choose to have it repaired by them. They should be ashamed of themselves. You buy the best you can with what you`ve got, only to have them ask for more of your hard earned money to have it repaired. Why didn`t I just give them double the money for it in the first place and ask them to hold on to half for when I need it repaired.","review","english","ACER","Alan Duncan","4","2018-03-29T11:42:45.000+00:00","Shocking service from Acer","1"

"dict","Acer is known for affordable yet powerful laptops and this still stands true. I very much enjoy the Predator Helios 300 laptop i purchased from predator and for almost 1 year had no issues with it. Now their customer support and repair facilities are another story all together. I sent my laptop in for a faulty power button which seemed to only wanna work when it felt like it. I receive a call a few days later being told that they would not repair the faulty power button until my screen was repaired. Now im confused because the only issue that my laptop had when it was sent in is a faulty power button and i tell them that the screen had not been broken. They reassure me with photos that they swear that my laptop had arrived with a broken screen ( I used enough bubble wrap that i could of played basketball with it perfectly fine). So being as is they offered to repair the screen at a cost of 687$ out of warranty cost (because it was not covered because of external damage source) before they could do the warranty repair for the faulty button. So seeing as i paid 1000$ for the laptop in the first place they want me to pay for a new one before they will fix the warranty covered button. The screen cost 54$ for a replacement. In the end i was told they would not repair my laptop and not only that i get it back with a broken screen. So i can not recommend anyone purchasing their products and warn all if you do ,do not rely on the customer support and document any case you have before you send anything in. I personally feel scammed and feel the company is at fault and is simply trying to cover their own asses so they can get out of repairing a faulty product.","review","english","ACER","Austin Crispin","1","2018-09-13T14:45:49.000+00:00","Acer is known for affordable yet…","2"
"dict","Bought an Acer all-in-one PC (Aspire Z24-880). Speakers broke 8 months later, with a burning smell coming from the machine and a loud high-pitched noise whenever it was turned on.   I contacted Acer to have it repaired, as it was still under warranty. They apparently don't provide any kind of collection service. You have to package and ship your machine yourself through their selected courier.   So, I then had to spend £25-£30 ordering a suitable box and wait for that to be delivered to me. I fully padded the box out with almost an entire roll of thick bubble wrap, covered the box in red ""fragile"" tape, and clearly marked ""this way up"" on every side of the box.   When Acer received it, they said that the screen was cracked. The only possible way that could have happened is if someone ignored the instructions on the box to keep it upright. Either the courier or Acer.  Acer then charged me £300 to replace the screen.   Acer refused to contact the courier about this or assist in any way whatsoever. They then had to order a part (from China, I imagine), which took weeks to arrive, before they could even start the repair. Their communication was non-existent unless I chased them up, and when I did, they were rude and unhelpful. They said things like ""we are busy right now and can't make promises... we'll work on it soon"". Numerous times, I asked to speak to the escalations/complaints department, and they refused to put me through.   I finally received my computer back THREE weeks later. Computers are a source of livelihood for many people in this day and age. To be without one for nearly a month is a big issue. They should have told me in the first place that it could take up to a month to be returned to me.

When I thought it is time to buy new things, I bought from them based on that. However, the laptop did not survive more than a month and catastrophically failed. It took too much hassle to fix and came back damaged after repairs.  In a the following few months, the monitor failed as well. It seems Acer used to produce good stuff in the past but not anymore. Obviously, they are only capitalizing on their past earned reputation but not the current quality. About the  damaged laptop after repairs, I complied but I found their staff rude and arrogant to admit the negligence and fault although I showed it to them after three pretend investigations. But the company did not care. When you have bad quality and people like these, what chance do you have. What it seems it used to be good company and good equipment but now they have new policy, new people and less quality. I would not be surprised if someone of Acer responds to this post to give the impression they care, they had many rounds to show that and the issue was escalated to the highest possible.

"dict","My wife's pc virtually died, and with Christmas approaching, I thought I'd get a new one as an early Christmas present.  So on 14th November 2016, I purchased a Acer Z3 All in One PC via Acer's website. The price was a bit higher than I really wanted to pay, but was tempted by their Cashback offer of £116 on a pc costing £700, making it quite a bargain. So I ordered it, and it turned up pretty quick. It ran so slow at first and I thought I'd bought a pup. However, after getting rid of all the Acer bloatware, we had it working very well and I was so pleased with it, I considered purchasing another once the cashback arrived. So I filled in the form and waited. Acer sent back confirmation that my claim was valid, asked for a bank account to refund the money into and I would receive my money. I did all that and waited. Nothing had happened within the time they said I would receive my money, so I enquired as to what was happening! I received an email from Marina at Acer who confirmed my claim is valid and I should receive my refund shortly. So I gave them a few more weeks; Still nothing, so emailed them again. and after 12 long weeks I have finally received it (Thank you Yohan!).  So Acer did it in the end and I am happy now, The pc is brilliant! so I have increased my lowly 2 stars up to 3 Thank you Acer; You produce some really good affordable pc's, but please in the future could you just offer a discount rather than all this cashback promise as its lost you a 5 star rating.","review","english","ACER","Allan Green","2","2017-03-12T21:51:22.000+00:00","Reasonable PC, but expect a huge delay for the cashback","3"

"dict","I just joined a new company; I need to be able to play the DVDs they sell on my laptop - and as my laptop has a DVD icon next to the keyboard, I was feeling quietly confident. So I inserted a DVD; the laptop made disc spinning noises for several minutes, but no movie. I loaded Windows media player - the ""insert a disc"" message didn't go away &amp; the movie didn't start. So I searched the web for likely solutions; guess what - dozens of other Acer owners asking the same question about their ""multi-media"" laptops! Tried 4 sensible amendments, including loading a 3rd party media player; still no dice. So I emailed Acer support; a reply asked some lightweight questions and suggested I could try the 3rd party program that I had already loaded. Plus ""as per the serial number this unit is out of warranty""; I hadn't told them a serial number... I replied with the steps I'd already taken (I was suspecting by now that I knew more than the support technician); the reply - which began ""thank you for the serial number"" (I still hadn't given one) recommended me to contact Acer Premium Support on a Freephone number, saying that the initial diagnosis would be free of charge. So I rang the number, expecting to get the usual runaround - and wasn't disappointed. Probably 10 mins to get my email and phone number understood, then the offer to put me through to a technician on a chargeable basis. They wanted me to pay to fix a problem that is on many, many Acer laptops. No thanks. The good news is they included a 10% discount code)I could do better than that with a quick search) for use on my next online purchase from Acer. Which will never happen - nothing new from Acer will come into my home again.","review","english","ACER","MR D B WHITE","4","2017-02-08T15:50:23.000+00:00","Don't buy a laptop from Acer!","1"

Finally after calling them I found out that the main circuit board had failed and they were replacing it. It arrived back after 3 weeks away and the outside of the monitor was all scratched up - the screen had a chip in it. I phoned them only to be told I had to prove it with photos. Eventually it got escalated and I sent it back again in June. I'm still waiting mid August to hear what's happened to it.

"dict","Bought a Predator GX-791 gaming laptop and lets just say what a mistake. I regret ever taking into consideration an Acer product. Between the repair side of things which is ambiguous to say the least and the reseller which I have also reviewed, this is something I will never forget. The unit was expensive being what was billed as ""Top of the range"", but honestly my 5 year old gaming rig is head and shoulders above this thing. Motherboard failure in the first 3 months.....took them 3 weeks to sort out because they don't stock the part you require so be prepared for an unreasonable wait, it took them 4 weeks from point of pick up to delivery after repair. So if you work on your computer prepare to go broke. Then 14 days after receiving the unit back from the repair centre a vertical line appeared on my screen so back it went on the 23rd of February and still no laptop because surprise, surprise no parts in stock! so what exactly do they stock? I have been without my almost 6 month laptop for 7 weeks of ownership. Acer customer service try their best but don't have enough information to make a difference and the website is also ambiguous, status of the unit ""is under repair"" a phrase which has come to infuriate me. If you have the money buy a Dell or Asus or something else which isn't an acer. Ironically enough we bought our daughter a netbook by Acer 2 years ago and hasn't put a foot wrong, so we got reliability for a tenth of the price.","review","english","ACER","paul","3","2018-03-13T13:54:15.000+00:00","Ace-r in the hole.

"dict","I bought myself a high-end Acer Predator G9-791 laptop in April 2016 and found I had no issues at first. But then started to have issues with each update on my Windows 10 from that point on. Then one day, my laptop decided it didn't want to go on any more and the help from Acer after this was something I am definitely not happy with.  The first issue in question was the anniversary update from MS. I didn’t know it at the time, but upon installation of it I would then no longer be able to get access to my desktop. I’d have a welcome loop on the log-in screen every time I tried. I had to reinstall the OS to get on it. It wasn’t until 3-4 reinstallations that I realised it was the update that caused it, so from then on I stopped it updating since I needed my laptop for doing 30 assignments over the year.   Next issue occurred when it was doing an update again, even though I stopped them from happening. This one downloaded automatically on the desktop and then kept trying to restart. When it restarted, I’d get a blue screen with a number of options after it encountered an issue and gave me an error code 0cx000000f. None of the available options to try and get around this worked since it just ""refreshed"" the screen, so I just had to press reset. It loaded perfectly fine, but would just repeat this cycle and never actually worked after trying to install the updates. This was stopped by contacted Microsoft who then hid the update with some software.   Last issue that occurred is to where it eventually died on me. I closed the laptop screen to put it to sleep for a bit and opened it later that night. Instantly it was on the predator logo with “Please wait while we install updates.” It didn’t even show me the desktop, or anything. But I didn’t see the loading circles that I assume should have been there. I didn’t want to do anything, just in case. After about a while, it was clear it was stuck. I tried to press reset, it didn’t do anything. I tried to turn it off, it didn’t do anything. Closing the laptop screen just let it continue to run as normal still. I was thinking I was going to have to let the battery drain to get it working again, but after 2 hours it just went to a black screen. I was now able to turn it off and on but it never did anything ever apart from show me a black screen.    I tried everything I could to get it to work. I contacted Microsoft about this who told me to try a number of things and then told me it was clearly a hardware issue. I paid £150 to get Acer ""premium"" technical help that wasted an hour of my time to tell me it was a software issue after guaranteeing me that he can get it back on, while also having an advisor that had no clue about what an Acer Predator was when his first suggestion was to take the battery out when an Acer Predator has an in-built battery. I basically already tried all of the tips to try and get it working again prior to calling, so paying £150 for this was like a kick in the teeth. All of these issues have happened within the space of a year. I don’t recall any update going on it as it should have, which makes me think there’s something very wrong with the laptop itself. As I also have a gaming PC I built myself with the same OS on it, that hasn’t had any of these issues.   I'm more than capable of fixing most issues I've encountered with my computers, but this one seemed to have been impossible. I sent my laptop back to Acer, who then told me ""Main board proposal"" as though they didn't even know for certain.......while also wanting to charge me nearly £1,700 which was £250 more than the laptop cost originally.  I would have thought buying a laptop for that much would have came with more than a simple 1-year warranty, and even if it didn't, I expected it to have last more than 18 months while also not having issue after issue from updates not working on it. I've bought graphics cards and motherboards for a fraction of the cost and had 3-4 years of warranty. I definitely won't be purchasing anything from Acer again.","review","english","ACER","Damien Marc Greenhalgh","1","2018-01-29T06:12:58.000+00:00","From working to dead in 18 months.....","1"

"dict","Never, ever buy anything from this company. From the moment I bought this laptop I had nothing but trouble. After sending the unit back for repair, it came back with a minor fault on the screen. So much for quality control! After returning it again they told me that I had caused the fault as the screen was broken and they refused to repair it under the so-called warranty, which is not even worth the paper it's written on. I asked for evidence of their quality control and what procedures they went through - which surprise surprise they would not give me. So now i have parted with nearly 280 pounds of my hard earned cash for a useless piece of plastic - well, not even that as I refused to pay the 130 pounds for a repair. You have been warned, never ever deal with this company or its products. I have been stung by these faceless people the hard way. I bought the useless thing for my wife so she could work at home, now she has to use my own laptop, an MSI, which has given me faultless service over the last 3 years.
