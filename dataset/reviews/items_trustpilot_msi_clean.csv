"Bought two curved gaming monitors from them as they were advertised as 1ms response time. Turns out that’s only on the fastest setting which makes your screen very dark and you can’t adjust the brightness. So I emailed their support team to ask what response time the normal and fast settings were, so far in 2 weeks I’ve had 4 responses. One says they don’t know and that’s it. And the other 3 all day check the manual (which doesn’t give the information). Extremely unprofessional and rude and I won’t ever buy anything from them again.",english,msi,Kerry Bennett,1,2018-11-29T07:50:48.000+00:00,Bought two curved gaming monitors from…,1

"Got a decent deal on a really well-spec'd desktop computer but a couple months later the problems began. Frequest BSODs led to an extended, slow-motion customer service exchange which ultimately required me to ship the massive computer back to MSI's Southern California repair facilities at my expense (over $110). I was without the computer for about a month while MSI took their time.  MSI ended up replacing a number of core harwdare components that probably should never have passed QC. I normally buy Dell and I've always had responsive customer service and fast fixes where Dell paid for overnight shipping. MSI also cripples the hardware on their pre-built computers by shipping with a dumbed down BIOS. For example, a standard Intel feature that speeds up video rendering is disabled because MSI won't allow turning on the on-board GPU, even though this is completely possible with the version of BIOS that ships with the same motherboard sold to PC builders. MSI support first told me to to enable the GPU that I had told them was not available in their BIOS, then proceeded to ignore all follow-up messages.  MSI doesn't stand behind their products, so any possible benefit from their well-spec'd hardware is completely negated by their horrible customer support and deficient quality control.",english,msi,RedJ,1,2018-11-25T00:36:51.000+00:00,It's just not worth it,1
"Current Date Nov 19, 2018  Around The start of October I RMAed my $50 Graphics card to MSI (fan failure) October 10th i recieved a notice that my RMA was on its way back Oct 13th they e-mailed me and said that it had been delivered (Fedex) but I never got it. Oct 18th - wondering what is taking so long i e-mail MSI / Fedex.  Nov 5th - I get an e-mail from MSI saying that they are trying to submit a claim but its not going through, but will keep trying. they never get back to me. Today (called MSI and Fedex) - Here's the deal.  It seems likely the Fedex did deliver my package, however they NEVER asked for me to sign for it.  They didn't ask me to sign for it because MSI didn't request for it to be signed for because it costs the more money to do that. MSI didn't ask me if it needed to be signed for nor even give me an option up front to ask if it should be signed for (as far as I know). If I had known that I needed to request that it had to be signed for I ABSOLUTELY would have requested it because my neighbourhood is not a safe place to drop stuff. However because i didn't request it, its my fault. Not fedex's, not MSI WHO SHIPPED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. mine.  So if Fedex doesn't accept MSI's claim that they lost I'm out my GPU (which btw MSI tells me will take at least 14 days JUST TO FIND OUT!) Your GPU is gone kid, too bad but its your fault that we wanted to save a few bucks.",english,msi,Daniel Kipp,1,2018-11-24T15:31:02.000+00:00,Demand that MSI request signature delivery,1
"Had a faulty GPU and emailed them, they refused to do anything as I wasn't a partner, and instead said I should sign up on the forum for tips. Ended up having to sell the GPU on eBay for a loss, I know it's partially my fault for getting one second hand, but I will be trying to avoid MSI products in the future if possible.

"Worst customer service EVER!!! Buyer beware!  After buying a $1000 laptop, the LCD screen broke. I requested to return the laptop to MSI to fix it. It all started off when I needed the serial code in order to fill out the return form. The serial no. had rubbed off of the bottom of the laptop. I called them about this, and after being on hold for 45 minutes(!!) they told me to use the serial code off of the charger. I did precisely that and returned the laptop to their return adress in Poland. They provided me with a repair-tracking link which I kept checking up on. The tracking link provided to me by UPS said that my laptop had already been delivered to the MSI adress in Poland 3 days ago whilst the repair-tracking link was stuck on ""approved"" and still hadn't moved forward to ""received"". I e-mailed them about this and never got a reply. I called them a week later. This is when they told me they had changed the serial no. I put in (you know, the one from the charger) to the serial code from the bottom of the laptop. Because of this, I was tracking the repair status of the charger of my laptop instead of the actual laptop itself. They never informed me about this change. They then told me that, after four weeks!!!, the laptop was already on it's way back to the Netherlands (with nearly a week of delay). They were going to provide me with the correct tracking link for the UPS parcel which held my laptop the very same day- this was a friday. Except they didn't. And since they're not available on the weekends I had to wait until the next monday, 9 am before I could make another phone call. This was the day they told me the laptop was supposed to be delivered to my house. I just got off of a week of night shifts and was not in the mood for the doorbell ringing constantly so I stayed up 'till 9 to call them to ask them to PLEASE send me the tracking information. They finally did so and only for me to find out the parcel hadn't even made it from the Netherlands yet and had been sent 2 days AFTER MSI told me the parcel was sent.   Am very disappointed in their customer service. After spending this much money on a laptop I seriously expected a higher level of quality service. I've been very let down and frustrated by this and will strongly advise other consumers to not buy from MSI but get another brand of laptop instead.",english,msi,Lenneke K,1,2018-11-05T10:59:52.000+00:00,Worst customer service EVER!!,1
"Complaint Letter! Attention! Very dangerous shop! With the purchase of goods MSI in MediaMarkt stores you can be in a very uncomfortable situation. I bought a gaming laptop for 1300 euros, MSI GP72M 7.RD, on the aluminum keyboard near the spacebar, there were two notches on the outside of the screen from the inside of the laptop, since the screen was not damaged, I thought that there would be no problems and the store will not be notified and will not return the laptop. A month later, while carrying a laptop in a suitcase, these two notches pierced the screen symmetrically. I took the laptop for repair. For two months I received only the refusal of the free repair.  The first version of the service center was that the laptop fell and therefore the screen was stuck. The second version was that the laptop was pushed. The third version was that there was a clip between the screen and the keyboard, or something that pierced both the screen and the aluminum keyboard. There are no questions about what happened with the aluminum keyboard for two months and there were no answers. When they handed the laptop over to the store for service, the staff were extremely unfriendly, as he himself was guilty, having to carry the laptop back to the store immediately after opening the box. But the question is, where in the documents is that if you find a notch on the aluminum keyboard, then immediately carry the laptop back?  After two months of finding a laptop on duty, the notches were reportedly not going from the inside of the case as they were, but inside. Now to prove how it was impossible at first. And the question to the service, how and how to allegedly pierce the screen and the aluminum keyboard, so that, apart from two points, no traces are left, remains unanswered. The result, I can not get a laptop out of repair for two months. The bill for the repair of the screen was sent to 260 euros, and within two months the service does not confirm in writing a notch on the aluminum keyboard. All that remains is to sue the shop and the manufacturer, terminate the contract and return their money to 1300 euros and forget about the MSI and the media market.   Vorsicht! Achtung! Mit dem Kauf von Waren MSI in MediaMarkt-Läden können Sie in einer sehr unangenehmen Situation sein. Ich kaufte ein Gaming-Laptop für 1300 Euro, MSI GP72M 7.RD, auf der Aluminium-Tastatur in der Nähe der Leertaste gab es zwei Kerben auf der Außenseite des Bildschirms aus dem Inneren des Laptops, da der Bildschirm nicht beschädigt war, dachte ich, dass es keine Probleme geben würde und der Laden nicht benachrichtigt und nicht den Laptop zurück . Einen Monat später, beim Transport eines Laptops in einem Koffer, durchbohrten diese beiden Kerben den Bildschirm symmetrisch. Ich nahm den Laptop zur Reparatur. Zwei Monate lang erhielt ich nur die Ablehnung der kostenlosen Reparatur.  Die erste Version vom Service Center war, dass der Laptop fiel und der Bildschirm daher durchstochen wurde. Die zweite Version war, dass der Laptop geschoben wurde. Die dritte Version war, dass es einen Clip zwischen dem Bildschirm und der Tastatur gab oder etwas, das sowohl den Bildschirm als auch die Aluminiumtastatur durchbohrte. Es gibt keine Fragen zu den Fragen, was mit der Aluminiumtastatur seit zwei Monaten passiert und es gab keine Antworten. Als sie den Laptop an den Laden übergaben, um zum Service geschickt zu werden, waren die Mitarbeiter extrem unfreundlich, so wie er selbst schuld war, er musste sie sofort nach dem Öffnen der Box, dem Laptop zurück zum Laden tragen. Aber die Frage ist, wo in den Dokumenten ist, dass, wenn Sie eine Kerbe auf der Aluminiumtastatur finden, dann sofort den Laptop zurück tragen?  Nachdem sie zwei Monate lang einen Laptop im Dienst gefunden hatten, wurden die Kerben angeblich nicht von der Innenseite des Gehäuses nach außen wie sie waren, sondern drinnen. Jetzt zu beweisen, wie es zunächst unmöglich war. Und die Frage an den Dienst, wie und wie man angeblich den Bildschirm und die Aluminiumtastatur durchbohren soll, so dass, abgesehen von zwei Punkten, keine Spuren mehr vorhanden sind, bleibt unbeantwortet. Das Ergebnis, ich kann einen Laptop zwei Monate lang nicht aus der Reparatur bringen. Die Rechnung für die Reparatur des Bildschirms wurde an 260 Euro gesendet, und innerhalb von zwei Monaten bestätigt der Dienst nicht schriftlich eine Kerbe auf der Aluminiumtastatur. Es bleibt nur, das Geschäft und den Hersteller zu verklagen, den Kaufvertrag zu kündigen und ihr Geld 1300 Euro zurückzugeben und den MSI und über den Mediamarkt zu vergessen.",english,msi,Nikolaus Erney,3,2018-11-04T18:59:04.000+00:00,Complaint Letter!

"I can't speak for others but my experience with this laptop has been a horror story. Problem after problem. The ""awesome"" LED keyboard stopped responding. I got a few bluescreens (which randomly just happen). When i'm typing the computer takes a mind of it's own sometimes and randomly backspaces and has a key ""stick"" and type 10-20 of the character, all the time. The memory cache always has to reload and the cache on the desktop won't even load anymore (dead icons). And to top it all off, the hinge on the left side broke, as I was closing my lid the other day. Now I can't even close it without significant effort. There are more issues but these just the ""major"" ones off the top of my head. Initially when the problems began, my issues were under warranty. However, it was a bad time in my life and I was in the middle of moving. I kindly asked for help, as I, unknowingly, missed the warranty window by 4 days, after I regained my health, and they refused to help at all. I guess near death experiences don't count as hardship. All they said do was send back and pay $$$ hundreds to diagnose the problem at my expense. Now I understand that their warranty is up to them and you can appease customers or go by the book, to try and avoid being taken advantage of. But a company of this stature that receives ""Award on top of Award"" for great products should do better. I'm unsure of how these products are judged but from my experience, it's been atrocious and now i'm stuck with a broken computer. Do yourself a favor and search elsewhere.

Just after 3 weeks my A button broke and soon after my D button broke. I can feel that the buttons I use often are more loose. I can live without some buttons but today after 8 months suddenly one of the back parts holding the screen to the rest of the computer broke when I feel the computer down.

"SCAM Company, and Cheap Flimsy Plastic Devices.  After viewing reviews on youtube about different gaming laptops, I finally decided to buy the MSI GS73. This cost almost 2k gbp, and the hardware is indeed there. However the BUILD QUALITY IS INCREDIBLY POOR.  The whole screen is made of some flimsy plastic material, but the hinges are very small (roughly 1cm high only), very rigid, made out of metal, and attached to the screen using only a few PLASTIC buds. Took me only a few times of opening and closing before the heads of those plastic screws snapped off.  Warranty... got the thing repaired, but they use the cheapest ever delivery service, long story short: I could either drive 40 miles to collect it from their local warehouse, or take a day off work as they only deliver during weekdays anywhere between 9 and 5. Due to it being a ""high value"" package, there are no other alternatives available (neighbors / concierge / drop off, nothing!). (Not to mention, despite the warranty they repeatedly spammed me with alternative repairs not covered by warranty, some bs that according to them requires a replacement of the entire frame, and at the cost of around 300 pounds (to things that are yet again caused by the poor build quality, note that the gs version is relatively thin, and therefore more sensitive to heat expansion, causing the smaller metal parts around the USB ports to snap)). Note that this ""request"" of theirs came through a phone call, barely mentioning it has a cost associated until I specifically asked. Surely had I simply said ""ok"" or ""yes"" they would have sent me a big fat bill.  So... having gone through all that, roughly 4 weeks later I finally managed to get it back in the house. But guess what. Now, a few months later, the hinges on the other side of the screen have just snapped (perhaps the current uk temperature makes the plastic extra weak an vulnerable? but why plastic? why 1cm hinges instead of a metal bar supporting the screen all the way from the bottom to the top???). Never again, MSI, very disappointed. I expected a 2k purchase to come with a product that generally represents quality.  Equally disappointing is the amount of highly negative reviews in this thread.

"I purchased what I thought was a top class Gaming GT72 VR 13 months ago.  Within 6 months there were multiple problems with the system, crashes, lags and random restarts. MSI’s policy on repair is poor and it consists of the item being shipped away for a period of time with the usual threats of bills if it is user error!

Within two weeks the fault returned and was again repaired, with a motherboard replaced,  Usual wait, slow turnaround.  When it was again returned the repair lasted 48 hours.

And im waiting and waiting for the price i would tought oh motherboard okay. maximum of 300... Then about 4 weeks later they send a invoice of 780+ for a repair for a motherboard and a battery. Ok ok. im not going to pay that much.  So i called the support multiple times and when I finaly had someone that wanted to help me he told me he could offer me a (Refurbished or laptop that was deliverd in a wrong collor for so so so so so much less the price then the repair price. They send a invoice of 680 without BTW. I said that's so much then they mailed back ''Uhm yes we can't repair your old laptop anymore). Basicly they wanted to let me pay for a new one. Realy sad.  - Support. - Comminication.,english,msi,David P.,1,2018-05-09T22:19:32.000+00:00,Msi Customer service,1
"Just absolutly garbage. I bought my MSI steel series notebook and loved it to death. Until one day the fans stopped working (oh and right after the warranty expired too.) So i took it to idk how many shops to get it looked at, I called them first and me living in Maui, they said they can't use a p.o. box and that's all I have. So anyway back to the fans. I finally find a shop to look at it and then a week and a half goes by. Guess whats the problem.....the motherboard is. On top of the 150 dollars I spent having it looked at I now gotta pay msi 70 dollars along with shipping and handling and then the cost to get a new mother board in! Yeah stay the hell away from msi its not worth your time.",english,msi,Steven Smith,1,2018-04-25T13:51:28.000+00:00,Just absolutly garbage,1
"I bought MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti DirectX 12 GTX 1050 TI 4GT LP from newegg.ca and owned the product for 15 months. Recently one fan started making some noise. After PC case disassembly, I discovered that one fan failed and did not rotate smoothly and ultimately had to be replaced.  I applied to MSI Australia (as I temporarily live here) and here is what their guy (Wayne (no last name)) replied: 1.	MSI treats pc components like cars: they do not warrant products brought from overseas, however, there were no difference in product produced for Australian or for North American markets. 2.	They cannot fix broken fan even if I am willing to pay for it. Cannot they also ship me a replacement OEM fan for my money, so I cannot fix it by myself. Conclusion: card is unfix-able. 3.	MSI Australia recommended to go back to North America and ask them to fix it. OK, fine, MSI Australia ultimately says to throw $200+ graphic card away due to failure of $5-$10 cooling fan. Let’s see what MSI Canada says. Here is what they replied: 1.	North American warranty service advised to go online, where I was requested to agree to receive the replacement product on valid address in USA or Canada. In different words I have to buy return ticket back to Vancouver, BC for $1600 or so, just because MSI cannot enter Australian address on a shipment package.  (Jesus Christ!)  2.	Further correspondence with North American service department was not fruitful. The guy (Kien Hoang) recommended to apply to MSI Australia, which I already dealt with.  3.	The response to my question to send replacement fans for my money and disregard the warranty, also did not result positively. The guy stated the MSI North America does not have cooling fans for VGA cards.  Ultimately, MSI North America also says to throw $200+ graphic card away due to failure of $5-$10 cooling fan.  So, think twice before buying MSI. Obviously, it fails like any other brand. The service though is one complete non-sense. They will do everything possible to screw you and not to fix (even for your own money) the defective product. I have the entire e-mail conversation chain to prove it. Legally, as per policies they developed for themselves they are right, but in physical reality it is a travesty.  Therefore, I DO NOT recommend purchasing MSI. That was the 1st time I got MSI and hopefully the last one. It appeared to be a disposable product that lasted 15 months, for which MSI refused to take responsibility, covering themselves with policies developed by them for themselves, even if you are willing to pay for simple replacement parts like fan.

"Absolutely pathetic the way these people handle (or don't handle) support issues! Their product quality is extremely bad now, too, which is more in need of solid support! It seems they are throwing machines together without proper testing and have gotten a terrible batch of keyboards. This has been going on for over a year in forum but no one to reply. The only option is for them to ""Shotgun"" the problem by replacing the keyboard, presumably with the same bad ones because people are screaming that they get their machines back and 2 weeks later the problem is back again! The majority of PCs they make will have some keyboard issue within the first 6 months of use, THE MAJORITY! They don't have any answer or solution, though this appears to be a top issue, and no local repair. So, you have to bounce your machine back and forth across the country and get it back without the problem solved. Their support ticket system is horrendous in itself! They dump put way too many detailed options that you are supposed to select from under each pull down tab as you fill out sections to the trouble ticket. There are some OLD machine part numbers and some 200 other options to sift through for each option, and you are supposed to read each one and select one that matches your trouble, your machine, your motherboard and about 20 other options where literally NONE of the choices match. This looks like a kindergarten operation when you see this and suddenly you begin to understand where underlying problems are in the company! THEY ARE EVERYWHERE!!! This is the case with the entire ticket system, and a 12-year old could instigate a better system or just clean this one up to make it more usable and not more aggravating!! It's been this way for years and no one bothers to fix it, so you get the mentality of how they deal with ALL problems and whyt they aren't being fixed either! It looks like an operation that is working out of their GARAGE!! The login knows all of this detailed information about your machine already because you registered your machine and it shows all these detailed options. But, the trouble ticket has none of these options to select and not well integrated with the website. There is not even an ""Other"" or ""Not listed"" choice, and no way to auto-fill the options. It's the most ridiculous I've seen, that they would even show this to customers and ask them to use this? It's misdirected, broken, and doesn't speak well for the company! I would be embarrassed! Further, almost everything else on the website auto-fills this information or gives you options to select which machine you have registered with them. But, not in the most important instance, like trouble tickets. The forum is laughable, too! There is never an MSI rep to answer or provide help, they never even look at the forum, so you just have people with problems, some for over a year, complaining to each other, some with ""try this and try that"", and no real help from MSI, ever! The biggest issue are basic keyboard problems and keys not working. People have indicated that the keys work on Linux OS, but not windows, so it would say possible software issue, maybe the BIOS, a Driver or other software settings issue. The only thing MSI is doing for these problems, according to numerous recent forum complaints, is asking you to send the machine to them, MSI shotguns the problem by replacing the keyboard, and you get your machine back that still has the problem and the 5 weeks you were without your machine has done NOTHING to fix the problem! Nothing can be more aggravating and losing customers faster than this! I want to fly out there and wring their scrawny necks for lying to me, promising a supervisor will call me back, and never getting the courtesy of a returned call after telling me they will call or look into the problem. This is just a small taste of the general B.S. they impose on customers. They don't realize they are destroying their customer base and repeat customers! They instead hide from customer problems and provide canned responses that don't help. Obviously, they are throwing machines together so quickly without proper testing and they have some major Keyboard problems with every model! People on the forum are complaining about getting the same problem back after sending their machine in, bouncing it across the country and back, and 2 weeks later they have the same problem! This will be my first and last MSI laptop! Pathetic is the best way to describe them and the best they can do, and they don't seem to care either way! This is unacceptable behavior from you, MSI! The rest of us do care, particular with the price we pay to have what should be a better machine and reasonable support! You did this to yourself!

I had a problem with updating the BIOS (didn't know how to update bios), so I asked the support, and a week later, I got an email where they just redirected me to the driver page. I later found out there was a mini-instruction there, but did they tell me there was a instruction there? No.  I followed the instruction, and on the last part, I had trouble flashing the file. So I asked the support at again, and waited in many weeks. I wondered why I didn't get any answers, so I checked my support history on MSI Support page, and found out they had deleted my support ticket.

"Customer service does respond to your problem but it is not very helpful. First off, I bought a notebook which, I later found out, suffers (as many MSI notebooks do) from their cheap fans. after a couple of months both my fans are very loud and rattle all over the place and so I thought: ""fudge, 1300 EUR down the drain, but maybe I replace the heat sink (because you can't just replace the cheap fans, no, you have tro replace the entire heatsink which will cost over a hundred 100 EUR). anyways, contacting MSI to ask where the hell can I get the proper heatsink gets you provided with a link  to a side which seems to be not updated since 2009 and surprise, no matching heatsink. thanks for nothing. Oh, and did I mention the first question from MSI support after describing my problem was ""did you update your BIOS?"" this may work with people who have no clue about the hardware they're using, but this is an insult and a shady business practice for they KNOW exactly what faulty products they ship. well, I guess lesson learnend. I recommend to AVOID MSI if you're not pooping money out of your buttocks. and of course I don't send my notebook to Poland or some country far a f-ing away to just get the same worthless fans replaced again as so many people told that this took place.",english,msi,Ursula Beutelhuber,1,2018-04-09T18:27:01.000+00:00,better spend your money elswhere,1

I called tech support and described the situation. I told the rep that I could not get 4.0 Gigahertz. I must have pronounced it wrong because he asked me “what is a giggahertz? Never herd of that! You mean Gigahertz?” He told me about the slow_mo switch, when I had already meantioned. He told flat out to just RMA the motherboard and be done with it. I hung up, changed more settings on the Overclock options, and finally got it to work (Set CPU ratio at 40, CPU clock 40, turned speedstep off, set the voltage to Fixed and applied all this to 2 out of 4 cores. When I had used all 4 cores the CPU was at 100% usage all the time). MSI has some sassy little snots working for them.

I purchased a Motherboard from MSI with a $10.00 rebate. I submitted the rebate on line with all proper documentation. After Several weeks I checked on it and they declined it. Stating I did not provide an invoice - Clearly there was a picture of the invoice right in the attachments. When I pointed this out to them they AGREED and said Sorry the date has passed we no longer provide rebates. WHAT? I pointed out that I submitted on time with all the proper documents. They agreed...Then said NO we will not provide you a rebate because 8 weeks past and the date for the rebate ended. It was their mistake - repeat -  their mistake and they refused to provide the rebate.  Yes..True all documented.    Oh Just wonderful Customer service!!!   Just proves the point the big company counts on not paying out rebates....   They are willing to loose a customer over $10?!   Really?

"MSI is cool:   Dear MSi!\n\nI\'ve just purchased two N780 Lightning VGA cards today to run them in SLI.\nSLI is working fine, however, in the VGA Fan Control software that is supposed to control the 3+3 fans on the cards, I can only control one card\'s fans. When using Afterburner I can only turn the 2+2 side fans up on the two cards, which is disappointing because since I\'m running in SLI I need all the cooling options that I can get.\nPlease, provide me with a solution that I can control all of the fans of both cards with.\nAlso, I can\'t register my cards, the website won\'t accept my legit serial number (from the sticker on the side of the box). What should I do?\n\nThank you in advance, kind regards,\   Dear sir/madam Thanks for contacting MSI technical support.  Regarding your concern, I am so sorry that we have no ideal about this.If the two CARDS with SLI,I think that as long as it can adjust the first a graphics card fan speed.it is OK.so I am so sorry that I cannot help you.   Thanks for your cooperation in advance!  Best Regards, MSI Technical Support Team   Dear MSI! I\'m afraid I can\'t accept your answer. I\'ve bought two products that you have manufactured. I\'d like to utilize both of my products to their full extent, and I can\'t do that due to sotware limitations on your part. The correct way of fixing this problem is fixing your software. N780 Lightning has been out for quite a few months, many are using two of these cards in SLI. I\'m not the first one to bring this topic up, and it\'s unresolved. 1. Afterburner should be able to control all the fans on both cards, even seperately - you\'ve actually promised to make Afterburner support the N780 Lightning card, but truly it\'s not supported because of this 2. If Afterburner, for any reason, wouldn\'t control the card to it\'s full extent, the included VGA Fan Control software should be able to do it. It does - but doesn\'t contol a second card. You product\'s box clearly says that it\'s capable of running in an SLI configuration, but your software still won\'t support it. I think that would be an unfair business practice and misleading, false advertising, because the software that\'s supposed to control the card is clearly not ready for using two of them in SLI. I\'m asking you to, please, provide me with a solution that can reliably control these two cards\' cooling in SLI. To help you out, for some reason your software actually sees my second (bottom) card, not the top one. Couldn\'t it be done by some tweak that your VGA Fan Control software would control both cards at the same time with the same settings? I\'d be happy with this solution.

"Like the last review, I have had my laptop for 18 months. Within 4 weeks of having it, the webcam stopped working due to a driver fault, along side this the mouse pad also developed a fault. The laptop was replaced by the retailer as it was deemed a manufacturing fault.  After receiving the replacement laptop, 6 months later the webcam stopped working again and the same problem with the mouse occurred. I sent the laptop away to the UK repair centre for it to be returned over 3 weeks later with damaged pixels on the screen and all of the dust covers for the card slots missing. I tried to get back in touch with them to report this, but had no luck.  A further 6 months after having the repaired laptop back, the screen pixel damage has got worse, the mouse pad has developed a fault again and now the hard drive is failing!  After 2 months of emailing and trying to call them, I finally got through to their customer service (which for a UK support centre had limited English vocabulary) to be told basically the UK repair centre wasn't good enough and if I sent it to the Netherlands they'd 'hope' it would get fixed there.   I then asked about a replacement, to be told only after 4 repairs of the same fault would they consider a replacement! In which I replied 'what if the laptop breaks again with the same, known faults 3 months later and it's outside of the warranty?' I was told it was tough and I would have to pay for the laptop to be repaired.  I can honestly say this is the worst laptop I've ever had and the worst customer service I've had to deal with!
