"Don't ever buy one of their computers. The computers are of poor quality, and will most likely die out after a year or so. Their customer service is equally trash. They don't listen to your issues, and when i sent in my Alienware 14, they kept it for 15 days, just to send it back with a new charger, completely ignoring the acual issue. I then sent i back in, but they said nothing was wrong, and this time they also messed up my harddrive, even though it was working proberly when i sent it in. Do yourself a favor an buy from anyone but this company.",english,alienware,Simon,3,2018-07-04T10:19:37.000+00:00,"Bad computers, even worse customer service",1
"Cant believe Dell and Alienware are still in business. Purchased top of the line Alienware 18. It died on the first day. Spent over 12 months trying to remedy the problem. Then Dell wouldn't honor the warranty. Ended up in court. Buy Dell if you like spending hours on the phone every day for months, If you don't actually want to ever use the product, when you finally fix the problem and pay for it $1600 your laptop will have depreciated %50 so hope your also rich. Oh yea and defiantly purchase the Dell premium warranty because it is worthless......",english,alienware,Codi,2,2017-11-03T09:06:36.000+00:00,Cant believe Dell and Alienware are …,1
"Having read reviews on Dell &amp; Alienware, I very likely shouldn't have bothered.  I bought a Alienware 15 (7820HK, 120HZ, 1070) and whilst the laptop itself has been the best one I've bought so far (bought MSI,Razer,ASUS ROG laptops before this one). It came with a dead pixel, which on a £1900 laptop is pretty terrible. I contacted support, went through the process to be told 10 dead pixels is the 'industry' standard and they refused a replacement.. Despite the fact the sales of goods act says products should be free of minor defects. Now have to wait for a return, will defo not be buying another...",english,alienware,Alfi,6,2017-09-23T10:59:15.000+00:00,Having read reviews on Dell & …,1
"I have no idea why there are bad reviews about alienware. I have and just had the best customer service experience of my life. VERY knowledgeable, helpful, and a wizard. I wish i could remember his name but he helped me reinstall all my drivers after a hard drive installation. I can not explain enough how helpful and amazing this customer support was. I hope his employer realizes how amazing this guy is and gives him a raise.",english,alienware,Levi Downey,1,2017-08-24T20:44:54.000+00:00,I have no idea why there are bad …,5
"Alienware Area 51 is a beast, love it, love it. great combination of strong performance, comfortable typingand an attractive design. I have the one with Core i7-7700HQ CPU; 8GB of RAM; an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU with 2GB of VRAM; and a 1TB, 7,200-rpm HDD and its reasonable for everything.",english,alienware,Ace,4,2017-04-26T21:57:30.000+00:00,Alienware Area 51 is a beast,5
"This comanys costomer service is non existant. Its a bag of lies.   So here is my story and i hope everyone reads this before buying anything from Dell. I bought a alienware laptop R4 top of the range. Put all of the best of it in there. Cost £3500 more or less. After the order had been placed i phoned up the next day to get a confirmation from them when i will recieve this beast of a laptop with high hopes just to be crushed by an answer that it wil take 30 days before i recieve it even though the website says 7 to 8 working days.   So being unhappy with this after a couple of days 3 or so, i phoned up to get a update. To find out by the voice machine that my dilevery date is unconfirmed. So went through to a agent and asked them what the hell is going on. All he said was its delayed because of a quality check in the factory in china. Why the hell its in china i have no idea. Another 3 days went past and it was now more or les 6 days of being sent back and forth with no idea what is actualy happening and im not going to wait more than a month to recieve a laptop i spent 3500 pound on. (All my money).   I phoned up again and asked where and what is going on and got the same quality check answer with no confirmed date of shipment. So i cancled the order. I bought a diffrent laptop from scan computers witch is fantastic. Recieved it in 2 days. 3 days later happy as larry enjoying my new pc. I go to the shop to by food and the payment dosent go through.   Confused i look into my bank account and im in 3500 pounds overdraft. Dumb Dell took the money. Phoned them up and asked what the hells going on. Oh my order has been shiped i wil recieve it in 2 days. But i cancled it. I want a refund. Its been over a week now with an overdrawn account. The order has been shiped and recieved back by Dell. The email i got today is its going to take 3 to 5 working days before i get my complete refund.   They dont care about customers and will drive them into the floor. Do not spend your money with these robbing cowboys.",english,alienware,Theodoruis lourens,1,2017-03-17T12:19:38.000+00:00,Burn it down,1
"Dell has horrendous customer service which has put me off for life. I have been lied to more than once and they often ignored the question I asked them. The laptop itself had severe light bleed issues and the processor got hot with a huge core temperature difference. Now Alienware are claiming that 100c degrees is a normal operating temperature for the CPU, which is ridiculous. 100 is the MAXIMUM before it shuts down. Price was very good but I guess you get what you pay for. Laptop has been sent back for a refund.",english,alienware,Tom H,4,2016-12-23T00:34:26.000+00:00,Bad customer service from Dell and issues with laptop.,2
"bought the m17, despite it comes at a premium price, there is nothing premium about this product or the service they provide. firstly, the laptop delivery came after stated delivery period. secondly, the laptop came in faulty condition. thirdly, tried to get refund, got passed around to at least 6 operators, once started to get reply from customer care team to process the refund(about half a week after the call), the operator is just flatout none responsive. It took them a week to get off their lazy hand to arrange a collection and take another half week for collection company to come, and then they tell me it would take 2 more weeks to process refund. I actually don't mind spending the extra money for a top notch computer and even it was faulty I thought I was just unlucky and would have re-ordered if the service was smoother, this terrible customer service is just hurting your own reputation and brand image and I don't think I will ever buy a dell or alienware product ever again.",english,alienware,Siwen mao,2,2015-09-20T14:31:23.000+00:00,Terrible experience,1
"My laptop is under warranty, they had already about 9 attempts of fixing that, every time they have failed and send it back to me assuming it is working but it wasn't. They do not want to replace it for a new laptop, as I am sure this one is having some manufacturing hidden problems that probably no one will never spot and fix.  So: - 9 failed attempts of fixing item under warranty - case is taking over 2 months so far and still not solved - many of their representatives just ignore my emails and left them without any reply - and much much more, but I do not have a time to describe all problems",english,alienware,Artur S.,1,2015-04-10T14:10:18.000+00:00,WORST COMPANY IN THE WORLD!!!,1
"I was supposed to get an AMD Radeon Silver Offer and choose the 2 free games I wanted the most, but due to the website being down due to a server overload, this did not happen. I was joint first in a queue to get my Silver Offer, but due to their website not being able to handle a few people on it, it crashed and I lost my spot. I then wrote a pleasant (honestly) message/post on their giveaway page asking them to help me out, but they have subsequently deleted it (don't have a copy of the message. Sorry).

A huge price to go with them.  Definately shop around (don't forget that Alienware are owned by Dell).  You'll get a similar spec machine for a good few hundred pounds elsewhere but it won't look as pretty!,english,alienware,Dave Hall,1,2012-04-13T09:16:54.000+00:00,Great items BUT....,3
you can build your own computer which will be more powerful and probably better looking for less than the price they are selling them for.,english,alienware,gordon,1,2012-02-07T10:56:12.000+00:00,overpriced pc's,2

"I ordered a very expensive laptop from alienware about 3 years ago, which in all honestly did exactly as it was supposed to, I was informed of it's progress every step of the way (build phase, packaging phase, shipping phase) and it all went rather smoothly. Customer service was great too, replied to email same or next day and were generally pretty helpful.  However the site is now a Dell Computers site and I never have nor never would order from Dell due to the horror stories I've heard about them. So today I'm really not sure at all if I would order from Alienware again...  The new site compared to the old one is awful, I tried finding a page for Alienware replacement parts and kept getting redirected to the same, unrelated page.",english,alienware,John Pilger,7,2011-07-13T00:32:49.000+00:00,"Good then, but is it good now?",3
Their products are extremely overpriced and some of the desktop PC's have had poor cooling configurations.  I'd only recommend them if you're looking to buy a gaming PC and have lots of money and don't want to build your own.,english,alienware,Stratos,2,2018-08-09T09:47:57.000+00:00,Overpriced,2

"Top service. And a great product, i had my Alienware 13 R2 delivered with incorrect screen. The tech switched it 4 days later with a new one. Free of charge. In My home. Great warranty. The only thing i can complain about is the price, i can get alot of hardware for the same price, therefor i can only give 4 stars.
