Having had two Razer Raiju controllers both with L3 button faults I couldn‚Äôt recommend anyone to buy a Razer Raiju. For ¬£200 controllers the look and feel is great but they are let down by this well known issue and no support. Support make it as difficult as they can to resolve any issue asking for several types of videos.

"Worst company I've ever dealt with. Bought the Razer phone 1 beginning of May. Simple phone features didn't even work. About the only thing the ""phone"" could do was play games. Even then it'd crash randomly. I've contacted them countless times with no replies for weeks. They stalled me for six months,ago telling me that there would be an update. The update only ended up making my phone worse. It's November and I finally received another phone after paying for the advanced replacement, and now they're not responding again when trying to send it back. They charged me twice and disappeared both times. Bunch of lying, thieving, pieces of garbage. Nobody should purchase any of their products and hopefully they go bankrupt.  I work in retail and this is hands down the worst customer service I have ever seen. EVER.",english,razer,David Pierce,1,2018-12-02T13:49:46.000+00:00,Worst company I've ever dealt with,1
I believe that the Razer Ornata Chroma is a very good gaming keyboard. The Razer Ornata Chroma has mid-height keys that allow for a faster response time when you are playing games.  I think we all can agree that when you are doing something you want it to be the most efficient it can. The Razer Ornata Chroma gives you that by giving fast times for gaming and this allows you to get an edge on whatever you are doing. You really want the Razer Ornata Chroma if you game at all because it gives you an enjoyable time.,english,razer,Jack Steinman,1,2018-11-29T02:16:28.000+00:00,I believe that the Razer Ornata Chroma is a great keyboard,5
Bought a lot of products from EU razer directly and only one product died. Warranty team replied on email in 24 hours accepted warranty and all went good. Received brand new keyboard back. Support team is very friendly and helpful especially live chat. Only thing i dont like is when you buy from Razer Europe store your package is shipped from Hong Kong. Took them 10 days to ship package to my home. Also dealing with customs is hell especially in my country (all went good but wasted so much time phone calls sending documents etc..) This is only downside and i give them 4 stars because of it.,english,razer,Mate,6,2018-11-29T02:29:36.000+00:00,Good company and helpful support,4
Every product I got from razer was amazing from start to finish. I got a mouse from a 3rd party seller referbished and they were more than happy to send me a replacement after that ones tracker went out. Idk many company‚Äôs who would be willing to help out under those circumstances. I have the black widow chroma v2 never had a problem with it! I have the razer siren x never had a problem. Razer kraken pros are a amazing headset I recommend every person gets. Also have 2 razer mouses a Naga chroma and a razer deathadder chroma both wonderful mouses!

"I've been with Razer since 2010, I think. Really loved the products, idea and so on.

Stay away from the Razer Phone 1 and honestly with having three of these sitting I my office all faulty and they can't bother to do a damn thing to help but they come out with a number 2 for 800 without helping their customers or fixing their issues stay away from the Razer Phone 2. I will be informing my 100k+ YouTube subscribers to stay away from this company entirely and I implore all hard working Americans to avoid Razer entirely. Let's show them with our wallets that they cannot take our hard earned money and offer us nothing in return and get away with it. My new goal for my youtube channel is to destroy inform Americans of this awful companies behavior and devices and make Razer a thing of the past.

"DO NOT BUY ""Razer Man O War 7.1 Wireless"" HEADPHONES. Bought my son a set for his birthday and in under 2 years (in Australia) the plastic head band snapped while he was putting it on his head. Razer said it only has 1 year warranty, so too bad so sad. No headphones (costing well over $200) should fracture ever, let alone in under 2 years. You can see in the photos that the headphones were treated very well as well.

"Trash company trash service, only makes crappy robotic copy paste replies to their customers to contact their crappy customer service line where they dont even answer. Dont bother emailing feedback@razer(dot)com because they wont answer nor care nor give a crap. They only make these types of copy paste replies to boost their trustpilot scores which is shady and fraudulent. Dont give them any service and dont ever buy from razer again. Asus, released a new phone better than the razer phone 1 and 2 combined called the asus rog phone, turtle beach and shure make the best when it comes to sound and microphones. logitech gaming equipment never breaks or has issues.  Its time to run greedy, garbage, fraudulent companies like razer to the ground. They do nothing but care about their own money and give 0 care for the customer.   The end of the line for me to stop buying from razer was when I ( a customer for several years who had purchased thousands of dollars from razer products before, because I actually thought they where decent, Stupid me.) was when I asked for a promo code they had about a few weeks ago that had recently expired. I explained that I would be more than inclined to buy several of their products if they allowed me to have that simple deal once again and generate me a personal promo code. Which they declined making the excuse that the promo code was for ""marketing purposes"" and could not be re made. to which I closed the chat with their useless representative, I contacted asus and simply asked for a PROMO CODE nothing else, and they gave me a MUCH better deal, the friendly and outstanding customer service rep from asus, who gave me an incredible deal, (Much better than what I had requested razer.) Who gave me more than 700$ in savings from their outstanding promo code.   I feel safe to say that I will never purchase another product from razer again, they have lost a loyal customer who has been there for them for years, and they have completely lost any and all of my business with them.

I currently own a DeathAdder Elite (previously the Chroma, and 3.5g before that), and BlackWidow v2, and they're great to use.

Razer phone horrible product even worst costumers service have been trying to get a refund after the first week of having this paper weight of a phone Razer refused any refund. camera  only works 50% of the time fingerprint scanner stops working out of no where and you've released 1 update in the year it's been out and that 1 update bricked a bunch of phones the sound volume which was one of the main reasons I got this phone got limited after update so it's alot lower then most other brands. The phone itself was supposed to come with a 80$ USB c  headphones as the promotion and I was sent the normal 30$ 3.5mm which are useless since this phone doesn't come with that connection.

Asked Razer for a refund on the keyboard as the product itself is obviously entirely defective. I wasn't interested in receiving yet another replacement keyboard that, according to my own experience and others, has a high chance of developing this problem within a week.

"I have owned 2 mice so far and both have been disappointing due to poor ergonomics and manufacturing quality. Most recently I am sending my Deathadder Elite in for RMA in Singapore and have been advised that I have to post it to the warehouse, even though their warehouse is less than 40 minutes away. It will cost me $10 to have it delivered in 3 days and over 40 minutes dealing with SingPost.   The RMA email states that it can take Razer 3 days to process then return via mail and is likely to take a further 3 days (minimum) to be delivered. That is around 9 days without a mouse (I don't have a spare). I could save 6 days by simply delivering it myself.  I've RMA'd things with other manufacturers before and they have taken time but they have always organised a courier or a direct drop off location to help speed the process.   Other brands have better quality products at lower prices. Won't be buying Razer next time.  EDIT: Was contacted by Razer regarding this review and asked to contact them.

I bought the Razer Man'O War headset.  With that first sentence you probably know where I'm going with this.  Two months in the head cushion broke off. Two years in the headset completely snapped in half.  What's worse is that Razer knows this is a known issue with the product.  That's why they built a new one without these horrible problems.  They refused to return it past warranty even though they know this problem existed before the product was even rolled out.    No recalls were made. No efforts were made to reach out to customers. And instead of simply replacing my headset they only wanted to give a $20 discount.  I'm sorry but that is unacceptable.  Michelle from Razer Support headed this up.  20$ discount is a complete lack of respect for someone who easily spends thousands in Razer products.  Officially done with them due to their poor Support.  Once my other Razer products expire I'm moving to Logitech.

"[edited]  TL;DR I like their products, but their online store and related ""security"" nonsense is outrageous.  And their customer service is useless.   Full story  Today I wanted to buy a mouse from their online store.  I filled the online purchase form with all data correct.  My shipping address was different than my billing address, as I wanted to receive the items at work (where I am most during business hours).  After maybe half an hour the page confirmed the transaction, I received an email from Razer stating my order was ""unsuccessful"" and to contact customer service.  I then started online chatting with a customer service rep, who asked me ""security questions"" - including the name of my employer!  Fair enough, that was in the order shipping address anyway, but so was my e-mail, so all that was quite a pointless waste of time.  He told me I would receive a call from their customer service.  After a few hours waiting, I decided to open an online chat once again.  Got through with a different customer service rep, who finally managed to get me called for whatever ""security"" checks they had, not before asking me where I was right now, as in physically (did not specify a reason - I live in a northern European country, not some banana republic by the way).  During the call, another employee tried to ask me for my work e-mail, which I obviously refused to disclose. Then she said I'd receive an e-mail at my personal e-mail address, with whatever ""security"" questions they had (which she did not disclose).  I stressed on the fact that they had wasted enough of my time, and that if this transaction was not solved by today end of business, they should consider the order as canceled.  It's nearly 17 right now, so I will contact another customer service rep through chat to ensure that my order really is canceled.   I will then proceed and never buy a Razer product ever again.   There are multiple issues here I want to stretch on.   1) Every normal online store will allow you to choose a different shipping address from your billing address without issues 2) An online transaction with correct addresses, phone numbers and card details should be successful (as long as the bank itself approves the payment obviously) 3) No online store retailer should ever ask you for any detail that's not relevant to the transaction (in my case, my current location and my work e-mail address, which was not used for the purchase) 4) Wasting prospective customers hours of their time and preventing them from purchasing for undisclosed ""security"" issues is an appalling business conduct, that should be sanctioned by factual boycott.   The business appears as ""unclaimed"" here (so these clowns might not even know or care what the customers think of them), and there is a duplicate thread for ""razerzone.com"" where I posted the original review.

"I've owned many Razer products so I'd like to think I've had a fair understanding of Razer products (I've probably spent around ¬£1000 totalled).   Mice:  The first naga (2014) I had middle click broke outside of warranty so I got the 2016 Naga and the tracking doesn't work properly. I did contact them to resolve this but they wanted a video of the issue happening and it only happened sporadically, I thought the issue fixed itself but a couple of months later it got really bad and now it's out of warranty and the mouse is pretty much unusable in games. In terms of quality the mice are good but in terms of reliability they're beyond poor considering my current 100% failure rate.  Audio: I've owned two headsets &amp; two IEMS. The elektra was decent but the Chimera (?) was terrible, very flimsy and generally poor audio quality. Since then I've owned quite a few headsets from other brands (Corsair 2100's, Hyperx Cloud, astro's, turtlebeaches etc) and for the same price you can do better. I owned two pairs of the Razer Hammerhead pro's and both broke in under a year, I replaced them with Sennheiser Momentums which have done me well and not broke.  Keyboards: The keyboards are good, never had issues with them. I've owned the 2013 and 2016 Blackwidow Ultimate keyboards.  tl;dr Razer products have a super high failure rate for me. Products from competitor brands on the other hand have a very low failure rate for me, I can't remember when a peripheral device has broken for me that wasn't a Razer device.. I'm personally very disappointed with Razer products considering the price.",english,razer,Zain Hassan,2,2018-08-25T12:13:06.000+00:00,"Good keyboards, poor mice, average audio",2

Their products are sometimes okay for a little while but break/malfunction within 6 months. I've been working with them to replace a Razer Wildcat controller. Its been well over a month and they still haven't even shipped a replacement controller. I shipped my defective controller to them weeks ago, the tracking info tells me that it has been signed off on but nobody has contacted me to say it has been received or anything. At this point i'm ready to tell them to keep the replacement, accept the loss, and go buy a controller from someone else.  Please everyone, listen to all of these reviews and go buy products from somewhere else.

"Back in May I ordered a headset straight from their website. Within several hours of using it the left ear speaker was playing at a considerably quieter volume than the right ear. No worries, I had warranty so I sent them an e-mail. Two months later still no reply. By now I have sent two emails and nobody has replied, even though they promise to ""reply within a day"".   This is just disgusting. If you're going to send your customers damaged goods, at least have somebody ready to deal with the angry customers.   Luckily I'm able to get around the issue of one headphone ear being quieter by just adjusting the speaker levels on my laptop, however if the headset broke to some extent within literally 3 hours of use I'm guessing that within a few months the other ear will break as well.",english,razer,Spaghetti Bolognese,8,2018-08-07T19:06:52.000+00:00,Non-existent customer service,1
"If I could write negative stars I would. I ordered a Razer Blade Stealth, the new later 2017 one. It arrived within about a week. The order had a promotion going on at the time, for ""$600 of free software (a few games and a sound editing software) It was supposed to be delivered via email, within 10 days of receiving the product. I received the laptop on June 23rd. I waited 2 weeks, and still hadn‚Äôt received the promo code. It took me contacting the company SEVERAL times, and all they could tell me was, that the promotion is held through a third company, and they had no information to give me. Once I threatened false advertisement they then told me I hadn‚Äôt received the codes yet due to my laptop being setup for a return and refund. I threw a fit, I was then put in contact with someone named Jorge. A day later he then sent me an email with some codes(On July 25th), which I have yet to be able to try, and that's not the worst part. After a week of owning the device it started having sever issues. (The screen goes black, the unit freezes, etc. all while working on a simple Microsoft Word Product) So I contacted Razer Support in the middle of all of this and got an RMA issued to me to repair the laptop. One of the times when talking with Jorge, he informed me the laptop was set for a screen replacement, and that the issues on the case listed for the laptop were completely incorrect. So after fighting with him for some time, we finally agreed to just have the laptop completely replaced due to warranty. Well, I was given a new RMA label, and was informed that my case had been set with accelerated replacement, and that once I drop off my laptop, a new one would ship out. Well, I dropped off my laptop July 26th, and its currently July 27th, I had yet to receive any updates. So I contacted Razer support AGAIN and was informed I had to wait 2-3 business days as they find an update for me. I paid $1500 for a laptop over a month ago that I needed for work, and I still don‚Äôt have one. Currently waiting on another phone call from Jorge who I guess is a supervisor.

"Great product - until the middle mouse button stopped working. Not the end of the world I thought, having paid nearly ¬£70 for a mouse I naively thought that Razer's customer support would be excellent when charging such a hefty price for a mouse. I thought wrong.  For what I thought would be quite a simple swap out issue has been a two week long battle through a customer service nightmare. e-mails back and forth, one of my e-mails had been ignored, leading me to go through the long, drawn out job ticket logging process again. I went to their live chat support, which unfortunately only supports US and Canada . They at least took notice of my issue and finally escalated it.  I then the next day received an e-mail saying I had to cut (with scissors) the connector cord on my mouse - i.e. vandalize the mouse I paid ¬£70 for. and then send a picture of it before they could process any request, and after damaging my defective property there is no guarantee that it will be processed. They did not specify when a new mouse would be coming to me - in all honesty I was actually stunned. I e-mailed back complaining about this and inquiring as to how long it would take for me to receive my new hopefully not defective mouse, and a different customer service rep sent me a copied and pasted message stating the same thing as the first e-mail. What an absolute joke. What happens when the new Razer smartphone comes out and it's defective - you need to take a video of yourself smashing it to pieces with a hammer?

"I have a keyboard, a mouse and a laptop from razer. The mouse died within 3 months and they replaced it with a new one after I sent the old one back. The synapse software for the mouse is an absolute nightmare. The mouse also has tracking problems depending on synapse version which they update it every couple of weeks, so one week it sucks and the next week it might be working fine until they break it again the following week with another update. Definitely wouldn't buy another razer peripheral, purely because of synapse. And if you uninstall synapse the peripherals don't work. As for the laptop, within 6 months it became a paper weight. It simply refused to power on. Mind you, it's a laptop that doesn't even have a scratch on it and has barely been used because I mostly use my desktop. It only leaves the desk when I need to demo something for a client which is maybe twice a month. I had to send it to Germany for repairs because there is no UK repair centre. After a couple of weeks, it got it back with a new motherboard. Since I got it back, it has been throwing BSODs every half hour with a different error each time. They also failed to fix the camera glitch that I reported along with the dead motherboard which basically caused the camera to show RGB scanlines/artifacting when the laptop warmed up. I sent it back to Germany and they promised to send me a new one that won't have camera problems and faulty motherboard. I've owned the laptop for 8 months in total and I have been unable to use it for 2 months. The worst part is that I actually rely on this for work, not gaming.

After opening the box there was a dent on the mic it self which I wasn't to bothered because I thought it was normal. After talking to my friends about it and looking online, it was clear that my headset was a defect and that it would randomly cut off when I play games with my friends.   Then I contacted Razer told them the issues and sent the evidence that was needed, a few days after turns out the warranty team declined the warranty, I was shocked!, I spend ¬£100 on the headset and the product was official not fake and I showed all the information and took all the right photos and still they decline me?.......   Okay I tried a month after obviously I would still use the headset since I didn't want to spend more money to buy another one, I contacted them again brought up the reference number etc then sent in the new photos. Bare in mind since theres a dent through time it would get worse... So I talked to a nice person called Luis, Honestly the guy is a great guy who cares about customers unlike most of the customer service team that I talked too. Carrying on I then asked him why did they decline me apparently in the notes it said ""Order Support (1:28:05 PM):They explained that the reason why it was rejected, was because the headset was deemed still to be working properly based on the recordings. "" So it was so clear they ignored the first issue and focused on the second one.......  AT THIS POINT I WAS MAD but I knew I had to stay calm and collected. So Luis tried again for me and after a few days I was contacted by one of the old customer service members which I really do not like because I could tell she was fake with me 100% kept twisting my words and that just made me angry and so thats why I am writing this review because I have been with Razer nearly 5 years now and I have bought many products from them but if they dont care about LOYAL customers why promote your company to gamers but dont show a clear understanding of what the problem is. Oh yeah if you are wondering what happened at the end I still got declined but I made it clear in the email that I WILL NO LONGER CONDUCT FURTHER BUSINESS WITH RAZER.....

"Razer phone has been out for about 6month now. I purchased mine back in December 2017. after 6 month my phone top part of the touch screen wouldn't respond. So I've called in and they ask me to send the phone in for replacement. They wanted the phone first and they will send It out within 2-3weeks after they receive it, which didn't work for me since I need my phone for work. So they ask me to advance replacement. I will pay for a another phone and they will send me a replacement razer phone and once I send in mine and they will refund me for my payment. So I agreed and paid another $762 including tax. I received my new phone (just the phone not in the original box) and send the defect phone in. Ever since they received my defect phone, they change their story everytime. first it was 3-5 days refund after receiving my phone and then change their story to up to 18days and now customer service doesn't have access to refund department so they will have to check with supervisor. it's been 3 weeks since they've received my defect phone and it's been whole billing cycle since I paid for $762 and now paying interest on my credit card.

"The Worst customer service imaginable. Like honestly i have had better service from porn sites. The products are amazing but holy crap there service is terrible. I bought a $160 man o war headset from amazon (thank god amazing customer service there) arrived with no problems. about 6 months later i accidentally broke the usb dongle to the headset. Now a normal person would think they could just use the usb cable that you charge it with but NO you have to buy a new dongle which by the way costs $20 with $10 shipping are you freaking kidding me. But like I said I liked the headset so I bought it.  then when the headset is supposed to arrive I wasn't home so the fedex guy sends it back to the warehouse like seriously. super upset I contact razor support and this idiot gives me some bullcrap generic responses on how i can just ""reorder"" and ""try again"" even though I already wasted a week of my time waiting for this stupid usb dongle ( should be noted that i tried my best to be considerate and cordial with the service employee). after 2 hours of chatting i basically said screw you and reordered it but made it clear i had not planned on buying from them again. Also you can olny buy the dongle from the razor store so be prepared to get ripped off. I skipped class and waited for another 3 hours for fedex to show up (God why can't they just use UPS) and the dude basically looked at my houses and decided I wasn't there and started to drive off so I chased the man down and got the damn thing.

"So I bought a Blackwidow keyboard from BestBuy, and I'm not going to lie, I do enjoy using it.  The buttons feel great and as someone who has pain in their wrists and fingers, I can really appreciate the work they put into the feel of their mechanical switches.    That being said, I have had only bad experiences with their firmware and drivers.  I used to have a mouse way back when (5+ years ago) that was given to me by a friend, and one day it was giving me trouble so I reinstalled the firmware for it and it bricked.  I vowed I wasn't going to use any more Razer devices after that.  Then one day my old trusty ps/2 port keyboard of 15+ years broke and I bought a Corsair one that made all my USB devices stop working whenever I restarted my computer.  I got tired of making sure it was unplugged whenever I restarted my computer, so I went to exchange it at BestBuy along with my friend, who convinced me to give Razer another chance...   Well, the keyboard was working great until I decided to install Razer Synapse 3.0 (couldn't figure out how to turn the lights off on it without the drivers, and the pulsing was giving me a headache.)  Below is an almost unedited exchange I had with their support.  Only change I made was in censoring my email, and their name:  Software Support (3:08:49 PM):Welcome to Razer Support, my name is [omitted]. Please hold for a few moments while I review your inquiry.

Like it was working for 5 years fine until I installed synapse  Me (3:26:14 PM):Litterally happened maybe 30 sec after I installed synapse  Me (3:27:33 PM):As i said it crashed my ugee drivers for my touch screen monotor so i closed it with task manager and it crashed windows right after  Me (3:28:12 PM):Might be a problem with having both ugee drivers and synapse together but this was cause by installing synapse  Software Support (3:28:42 PM):Maybe it was just a coincidence that after you installed Synapse it crashed. But we can't know for sure. As I've said, this is the first time we encountered this issue.  Me (3:29:00 PM):Oh got my other keyboard working now. My non razer one  Me (3:29:10 PM):Everything else still not working though  Me (3:29:57 PM):It wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. After i uninstall it i bet everything will work.

Me (3:43:58 PM):Computer works great now with non razer devices besides my ugee monitor. Like i said it‚Äôs probably a conflict between ugee and synapse   I admit that I wasn't as polite as I could have been, but this whole situation was incredibly frustrating.  I wanted to spend my day off enjoying my computer, not troubleshooting issues for a product that I paid good money for.  Ironically, the device that allowed me to solve the issue by uninstalling Synapse was a Chinese knockoff keyboard that somehow worked when nothing else did.

"After returning several different brands of keyboards (I didn't like the way they typed), I finally found the Razer Ornata Chroma.  At first I was happy with the product, because it was exactly what I wanted/needed. However it had several issues;  The first issue is that sometimes the LEDs go off completely for no reason, but the keys still function and I can type. This is more something of an annoyance, but still... A product in this price range shouldn't have this issue!  The second issue is far worse; at random moments I cannot type anything anymore. In this case the LEDs are still on, but the keyboard doesn't respond to anything anymore. Not even CTRL-ALT-DEL. The only ""solution"" is to pull the USB cable from the computer and wait a second or 2 to plug it back in. After that I can type again. This happens random, but often.  So after these issues I decided to contact Razer's support... Well, I wouldn't define it as support at all. Pretty useless and unprofessional!  In my first message I clearly mentioned the things I tried so far (different USB ports, BIOS updates, clean Windows install, reinstalling their sofware, etc. etc., etc.) I also mentioned all my hardware.  The first response back from them (took several days) was a list of things I should try, which I already tried and mentioned in my first message (sigh). Also they stated that it might be that I have a cheap PSU, which could cause issues... Yeah right... I own a EVGA P2 1200W PSU, which are one of the best in the industry, but sure they are the ""experts"".  In the next reply they asked for my serial, which I provided along with an invoice that the keyboard wasn't a week old! After that things went downhill pretty fast.  No more replies and they informed me I should return it to the store. Why don't Razer replace it in the first place? Why ask for an invoice and serial number? I could have returned it already days before without contacting their ""support"". USELESS!  Anyways, I told them I would write a review about their product, their so-called service/support and the response I received was astonishing!  They simply replied; post your review online, we don't care. Really?! For a company which advertises stuff like: ""Razer CEO: 'For Gamers, by Gamers' Is More Than Just a Slogan"" it's pretty bad. I now know their true colors. Razer is a disgrace for the industry.  They could take an example of EVGA; their support, their products are simply excellent. Something which Razer can clearly learn from them.  I have dealt with a lot of company's support, but Razer is by far one, if not, the worst of them all in my experience. I never experienced something negatively like this before.  Razer produces great ideas, but their products are mediocre in real life (reviews are paid for apparently) and their support... Well, let's call it abysmal.  Two big thumbs down for Razer! I will never ever purchase a product from them again. And do yourself a favour; if you are thinking about buying a product carrying the Razer brand, I would advice you to reconsider or make sure you can return the item to your local store if needed, because on their support you clearly cannot rely on....",english,razer,Mich,3,2018-01-10T11:17:39.000+00:00,After returning several different ‚Ä¶,1

"I should have read reviews on this page before ordering anything from Razer. But I didn't, and ordered a laptop for our son on November 17, plenty of time before Christmas. After waiting for two weeks I contacted customer support to hear what was happening with my order. I only received vague responses with terms like ""I will be escalating your case to the relevant department."". No information about if they had the item in stock, when they would be shipping it and when I would receive it. After a few more inquiries they called me back, and were still very vague about the status of the order. The representative said the laptop had been shipped, but they didn't have any tracking info. When I asked how he an item could be shipped without any tracking info, he avoided the question and said he had to check with the shipping department. I got a similar call twice. After realizing that the laptop would not come, at least not before Christmas, I ordered another laptop off eBay (got it 3 days later), and contacted the Razer customer support on December 16 informing them that I wanted to cancel the order and get my money back. I got a call back 14 days later (!), and the representative said that the laptop had been shipped (still no shipping info, and the order status page says the order has still not been processed), and that I had to wait for the package to come and that I had to refuse it, and that they would refund me when it  was returned to their warehouse. I still haven't received any package, and today my patience ran out and I contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge. Hopefully I will get my money back this way.  I have no idea how a company can run their operation this way. I don't know if the representatives are lying straight to my face or are just grossly misinformed.

"Appalling customer service. I ordered a Razer Blade stealth 12.5 on the 12th December with delivery stated at 3 to 5 days. 15 days later I still hadn't received my laptop so I contacted Razer via the online messaging tool to ask what was going on. The response told me that the laptop was out of stock and they were waiting on more to he supplied. I'm not quite sure why I wasn't told it was out of stock having paid a large amount of money, I was also given no timeframe as when to expect my laptop. As I was wanting the laptop to take away with me on holiday on the 30th I informed razer I would like to cancel my order as I would like the money back to buy a different laptop. The response I got to this was that Razer would request to cancel my order but this wasn't confirmation of a cancellation as sometimes products are dispatched before the cancellation takes effect......Not quite sure how this happens when a product is out of stock. Also once cancelled it takes 18 business days for a refund! This is ridiculous, that's pretty much 4 weeks to get my money back, all the time in paying interest on my credit card, and I'm also left without a laptop. I was really looking forward to my Razer laptop having read some good reviews but after this experience I doubt I will ever use them again.

"Absolutely disgusted with this company.  It is by far the worst online shopping experience I have ever had.  I ordered a keyboard and mouse as Christmas presents for my son on 24th November.  A week ago, still not arrived.  I messaged them and received the obligatory message saying they were extremely busy and struggling to get items shipped but it would be shipped within next 3 days.  Nothing!  Couldn‚Äôt respond more than once a day or in fact same day and could not guarantee delivery at all.  Did not seem to care either.  When I realised I wasn‚Äôt going to receive my order on time I decided to google customer service reviews.  Boy I wish I had done that first.  I ordered the items again from other companies and received next day and so cancelled my order with Razer.  No confirmation of cancellation until 3 days later I received this - what the chuff.  Considering legal action.  Hello Debra,  Thank you for your reply. My name is Emma from Razer Order Support.  We are going to place a request for the cancellation and we will inform you about the outcome as soon as possible.  Please, be advised that this is not a confirmation of your cancellation as, once the order is placed, the warehouse starts to prepare the products for their shipping as fast as possible. Rest assured, you will be informed if the cancellation succeeded or if it did not.  In case it is not successfully cancelled, we will provide you with the tracking link once available and you will be able to monitor the tracking.  Thus, you can reject the parcel once it is delivered to you and, therefore, it will be sent to us. :)  Thank you for your time and sorry for the inconveniences we may cause.  And, please, if you have further questions or inquiries, do not hesitate to include them in your next emails and we will gladly help you.  Have a nice day!

I sent in by email 3 tickets and called well over 10 times before i got free shipping lables and they only ever fixed the charging problem.

"Wow. I have just got to say how incredibly disappointed I am in Razer.   I have the black widow chroma, the mamba tournament edition, and the Overwatch man o'war headset, I love your products, the chroma series is one of the brightest, most customizable RGB series I've ever seen... but your customer service needs a serious overhaul.   I ordered the Razer firefly cloth mouse pad on 11/28/17. So from 11/28 -  until 12/12 I waited the suggested ""processing time"" of 4-7 days which later was altered on your website to 7-10 business days.   Finally, after receiving no word from you as to why this was delayed or taking so long. I reached out to y'all via your customer service option on your website on 12/12 wanting to know why it was still in processing after 14 days.   This is an excerpt from the response I got from Jude: ""Allow me to enlighten you further.The 'Ships' timeframe is an estimate of when the item will ship from our warehouse. If your item is in stock, your order is estimated to ship within 7-10 business days during the holiday season. Delivery will depend on your destination. Moving on to the good news! I am pleased to inform you that your package is already queued for shipping.Kindly await your tracking link in  the succeeding email.""  This came across a little cheeky to me- I don't need to be ""enlightened"" about things I can clearly read on your website. I messaged your company because my order was in processing BEYOND the ""estimated 7-10 business days""; Furthermore, I never received the ""succeeding email"" with a tracking number. My order was updated to show it had shipped but when I click the link that says ""track package"" it takes me to the Fedex website with the tracking field left blank. I responded to Jude via the email, like it said to if I had further concerns, 5 days later no response.  Today I contacted you via your online chat feature, hoping to get a quick resolution to this ever extending issue. But no, I was just asked to wait for 5 mins while he searched for the tracking info, which turned into 10 mins. When Griezl finally came back he had no resolution for me. Just said he would ""communicate with our relevant team regarding this"" and that'd he'd send me an email.  At this point I'm very frustrated with you, I do not understand the utter lack of organization or communication I have witnessed. As I stated previously I have always loved Razer, at times even been a fan girl of sorts... but you totally lost my business on this one. I won't be buying from Razer directly, if at all.   I even looked it up, I wanted to believe this was just a one off issue, that I just ordered at a really busy time, but look at all of the horrid reviews you've accumulated on just one review website: [this is the link to trust pilot] I shop online frequently, I've never seen a site with such consistently poor reviews.   So just, step up your game Razer. You used to be the best of the best, and while your products may still be high quality you have clearly lost sight of what it means to provide your customers with quality service as well.  -One seriously disappointed fan.",english,razer,Jane Henry,1,2017-12-17T19:08:36.000+00:00,Seriously disppointed,1

"I own three Razer products, including the 2017 Razer Blade. Not only are they always several iterations behind on firmware updates for Windows 10 compatibility, but they are also unapologetically silent in terms of communicating with their customers.  It seems like this company's all about selling it's product, but they even have issues with that too. I originally wanted to purchase the Razer Blade from the Razer store, but after three weeks of back and forth with the 'verification' department (after requiring that I send bank account information, confirmation codes, and IDs to them via email), I was fed up and placed an order from another vendor. One day later the other vendor shipped me my Razer Blade, while the Razer Store took another week to confirm my order cancellation.  Support is the worst. Practically non-existent, always full queues, phone just redirects to website links, and chat has copy-paste answers. Obviously contracted to some discount customer support shed in another country. Departments have zero communication with each other, and different tiers of support teams look at reports at the same time, with tug-and-pull decisions from two or more uninformed support ""specialists"" ruining any hope of any resolution to your problem.  If you're buying peripherals, stick with Zowie or SteelSeries. If you're going for an ultrabook, go for the ASUS Zenbook series.

"I purchased a Razer Blade Notebook computer. I was very pleased with the computer itself. The issue I have with this company is with their technical support.  I had an accident where the strap on my notebook backpack broke and fell to the ground. My screen was cracked. I contacted technical support via phone to find out the steps necessary in order to get a quote to replace the broken screen. I spoke with a knowledgeable agent who assigned me an RMA number and informed me of the necessary steps to ship the product to them. The RMA number was to expire in 30 days. While it took me a couple weeks to get it sent off the number was not expired. I got an email on November 9th, 2017 informing me they received my computer. That email stated it typically took the company 1-5 business days to contact me with a quote to repair it. I sent them an email on 11/15 asking for an update on the status of my computer and heard nothing. On 11/17 (today) I called customer service. The first time I called the call conveniently disconnected when the agent realized I was not happy. I immediately called back and spoke to another agent that was in India named ""Emily"".  She said the case had been escalated and the RNA number had expired before they received my notebook which is not true. ""Emily"" said she had no idea why they haven't contacted me with the quote. She informed me that she could not tell me when I can expect to hear anything. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told there wasn't one and that I had to wait until they contacted me.   This is ridiculous. I paid over $2k for a computer and followed all the instructions given to me yet I still have NO IDEA when I will get my computer back.

Which tells me they did not even read my email at all. This is what I sent them:    Let me start off by saying that when I invested in a nearly $3,000 in 2015 I expected the the piece of hardware to last more than 2 years. Unfortunately it has not, it has had nothing but problems and I have opened hundreds of support tickets with the company. However, recently my problem is that the computer started to speraticly turn on and off and it eventually stopped charging or powering on all together. At this point it was the middle of the summer. I submitted a support ticket though email after several increadably unhelpful calls (in 2 of which I was told the same advice.) After roughly 4 weeks of waiting for an answer I am told the battery has gone bad, and as your company don't sell the batteries separate I had to send it to California. Spending $80 of my own money for shipping. It was then returned to me, the address I was given was not correct. I send it again and I do not hear back from your company for nearly 2 and a half months. Each time I call nobody knows what the status of my divice is. After several calls a week I am told that it has arrived, and that it would be $200 to repair. I pay the $200, and am told it will take 5 business days. After 5 business days I check on the status and find out that nobody knows the status of the device yet again. After a whole month and a half (today, October 30th) It finaly shows up in the mail )despite the shipping tracker registering it dropped of the the wrong address.) Tonight after months of struggle I finaly have my ridiculously expensive headache back. JUST TO FIND OUT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED. The computer will not turn on and after a full day of charging, only remains on for 3 minutes. I am furious. This costumer and product experience has be absolutely horrible for the amount of money I played your company for this mess.   There are only 2 things that can happen now that will keep me from sending my experience directly to my publisher.   1. Your company can send me a WORKING System.   2. Your company can credit me the price of the device as I can no longer sell it.   And you will immediately refund me my $280 spent of this repair.

"I will say when you first receive a Razer Raiju they are amazing. BUT they don‚Äôt even last 6 months.  I‚Äôm on my second controller since they were released but have had Left Stick issues with both.   Even though they are advertised as 2 Year Warranty which in the EU is actually law anyway, trying to get them to fix or replace it, is beyond a joke!   I will not go into every detail as it will make this very long and boring. Just give enough details and facts to be relevant, to be informed enough on why you should avoid Razer products.   Firstly you can‚Äôt just send it back, you need to try and convince them that there‚Äôs even a problem with it. Only when you get a RMZ can number can it be returned. Every reply seems to come from a different person or what actually looks like a bot.  Not one of them seems to read the email you have sent previously. You can fill it with as much information and details as possible but it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve only read the first two lines.  They constantly ask you stupid questions like ‚Äúhave you tried it on another game‚Äù ‚Äúhave you tried it on another system‚Äù ‚Äúhave you tried updating the firmware‚Äù.  They don‚Äôt ask you this once, it‚Äôs a cycle day after day and the name on the reply is someone different. All of this information can be stated in the very first email but 10 days later someone can be asking you these same question you already stated in the opening email. Again the replies themselves are structured like they are a bot.   They also want videos. They try to make it difficult and complicated. The want videos of gameplay and your hand on the controller at the same time.  As I have a problem with the L3 that effects running I made a video and uploaded it to Youtube of how many times my character suddenly stopped dead!  After being thanked for the video, two replies later I‚Äôm being asked again for a video. Then another two replies later asking for a different video. The first video was more than sufficient to demonstrate the controller is in fact faulty.  Again this is the second controller. This replacement is not even 6 months old, so at this point I shouldn‚Äôt even have to prove the fault. It‚Äôs only after 6 months in which you may have to show there‚Äôs a fault.  But you reply and get a response from someone else.   After saying I wanted to make a formal complaint and wanting details of the complaint procedure, I received a reply saying ‚Äúsadly your Razer Raiju seems to be defective and needs to be replaced. I already reached out to the warranty team; my colleagues will contact you soon with the next steps‚Äù. But the very next day I received another reply from customer service asking for yet another video. I‚Äôve never been contacted by the warranty team.   I‚Äôve asked them twice now for this to be escalated to a supervisor and that I would like to make a formal complaint.  I suspect they just try to infuriate you enough that you just stop replying. They go on like you‚Äôre a moron. Of course you would try it with other games and such, you‚Äôre actually going to waste your own time. I mean the video I provided clearly shows there‚Äôs something seriously wrong. I provided a video of the controller its self, to show it had not been damaged or tampered with also. This was all provided in the first 24hrs along with ‚ÄúI‚Äôve updated the firmware, trying multiple games and tried it on a friends system‚Äù but every day you receive a response asking the same questions and from what‚Äôs supposed to be a different representative. Bare in mind I have a case number so all the information should be on their system never mind in the email thread.  They just do whatever they can to not not repair, replace or refund the product with by law they actually have to do.   I‚Äôve now contacted the ECC and filling a case against them. I no longer want a replacement. I want a refund. If they had just sorted out a replacement within a couple of days I would have been fine, but now, no. I‚Äôm not going through this again in another few months.   I personally know of two people with the same issue having the same problem.

What kind of a message is that sending to customers when the people working for the company admit how terrible it is?   This is a terrible shame because I actually like the products. They look good at first, but scratch beneath the surface and you find a plague of cheap parts that do not last long. For a product that costs so much compared to its competition, this is certainly not what you should be receiving.  I bought a laptop from Razer 2 years ago, which had battery problems from the start. I never used it so by the time I got around to getting it fixed, it was out of warranty. That's fine, my fault.  So I paid $65 to send it to their repair place, then they told me it would cost $700(!!!) to fix a BATTERY. They added on an ""optional"" $400 repair for the LCD screen which, as far as I could see, had absolutely nothing wrong with it. What a disgusting way to squeeze money out of people (who had already shelled out a whopping $2300 for the laptop in the first place).   This in addition to their mice products (first one I bought broke within 12 months of buying it, I stupidly went out and bought a replacement, which is currently falling apart after 6 months).

After a couple hours I decided to cancel the order and try to buy a different laptop locally in my area. This purchase was made on September 11, 2017. It has been over a month and I have yet to receive a refund for the laptop. I contacted their live chat support and they keep delaying. One day I contact them, their system is down. The next day, their supervisor is in a meeting and they can instead email me within 3 business days. This has been ongoing for 4 weeks now. I am at the point of going to my bank and requesting a fraud investigation against Razer. Such a dissapointment for such a hyped company. I managed to get some sort of compensation out of one of the Razer live chat support ""supervisors"". They said htey would send me a Razer BlackWidow Chroma for free with the refund. But all they've been telling me is lies. Lets see what happens.",english,razer,Nexxy Billz,1,2017-10-10T03:16:24.000+00:00,Holy crap where to start...,1

"I ordered a refurbished razer blade on the 25th of september, their estimates said 2-3 days to leave the warehouse and 3-5 for actual delivery, seems normal. after 7 days my order still said ""in process"" meaning it hadnt shipped yet. I opened a support ticket and they said they would fix the situation, and apologized. 2 days later the order is still ""in process"" so I opened another ticket they said their systems were down and to come back in 1-2 hours. So, after about 2 hours passed I came back, they then said come back in 24-48 hours. 24 hours later I opened another ticket saying they will email me a status update in 2-3 business days. This happened today, Thursday. meaning I will likely have to wait until monday, for an UPDATE. meaning I will have waited 14 days for an update an an expected maximum 8 day delivery.

"Wow hmmm where to begin ?  Just like other reviews say Razer is too much focused on security precautions rather than their own customers .. There is now 2 individuals on here that share that same experience I witnessed and went through.. Buying from Razerzone.com was easily one of the most dreadful stressful worst experiences ever in my lifetime of 31 years ! That's saying a lot as a matter a fact Razer upset me so bad I literally within that next week sold all my Razer products and replaced with Aorus we will get to that later .. Anyways it all started 08/30/2017 which was the initial FIRST order date. I ordered Razers Razer Blade PRO 4K 512GB with Destiny 2 and Intel game bundle . also was told after my order I would receive Razer Lancet wireless mouse.. So received my conformation saying congrats on your order Jason your order is in progress and getting ready to ship .. I was like sweet.. Great right ?? WRONG! I was than sent an email from Razer support saying my order has been canceled due to PO BOX for billing address but I gave them my Residence physical address for shipping purposes..obviously ! Well let me tell y'all this YOUR billing and shipping address must be exactly the same no matter what the case is.. On top of this it must match exactly what is on your drivers License so heres where everything take the turn for the worse  Please brace yourself.. Like for real hold on !!  So after this whole ordeal of being informed by email that my order was canceled I contacted Razer support and told them ummm that's my correct billing address and transaction won't go through your right no matter what! Get this these fools literally told me use your physical address that is on your drivers license lol..  I was like NO ! That's my correct billing address.. So I said I will get back to you guys contacted Pay pal which I used for payment to this awful company.. And I informed them of what Razer is telling me.. Pay pal was like what you mean on our end we show your order was successful congratulations on your new laptop purchase.. And I said ""No Sir I promise you on Razers end its canceled!"" Pay pal than made a case contacted Razer and you won't believe this Razer sent to my pay pal only as a flipping authorization not even a charge to my account ? So therefore on pay pals end of course it would show as being paid cuz it was authorized as my billing address matched exactly 100% ???? Pay pal was very confused ended up speaking to a very helpful lady named Jasmine who was a supervisor and she says quote on quote ""We have a lot of issues with Razer company in sending correct authorizations to a members account.. She says I'm terrible sorry for the inconvenience they have caused you.. ! üò¢  At this point I should have listened so finally the authorization fell off my pay pal account money was returned this is into 4 different chats 4 different cases now keep that in mind and yes forgot to mention that.. I really wanted the laptop so me the persistent dummy I am I decided to place another order to see if I put my physical address as my billing.. And my physical address as shipping so both would match exactly RIGHT ? Smooth order process now ?. WRONG!! No not even close after order was placed following criteria word for word from the case agents I received an email 2 mins after placing order saying sorry your order has been canceled please contact Razer support for further assistance . I was like BRO are you kidding me again and again ? Really so here we are from initial Order date 08/30/2017 and now it's 09/20/17 still not Razer Blade pro and still out my money from my pay pal.. Razer still has the damn authorization on my account for $3699 due to the $300 voucher that was given to me during this whole crisis to try and butter me up when I placed second order.. Anyways I finally gave up to make a huge long story short I sold all my Razer products including my old Razer blade 1060 QHD+ 2016 which was a glorious perfect laptop.. And purchased an Aorus 17 inch QHD+ DT V7 with GTX 1080 and 32GB of Ram 2400 MHTZ. 1TB Samsung 960 EVO SSD 512GB  Ok so anyways Razer customer service is a major issue I highly and I mean highly reccomend not ordering any products from them and if you do and have to contact support well GOD help you I will pray for you.. It was a cumbersome and very stressful experience that I say once in a life time was enough for me.. Never again will I purchase any Razer products  Like EVER !  Please find other brands with better customer service and RMA support  Thanks for reading I hope my review helps potential buyers of Razer so they don't experience what me and all these other negative reviews experienced",english,razer,Jay Sky,1,2017-09-24T02:58:06.000+00:00,Razer is by far the worst support you will receive period,1
"Where to start.... First.. like everyone else, placing an order was an ordeal because unlike every other ecommerce place on the internet, the credit card address &amp; billing address have to be ""EXACTLY"" the same... even though they have  weird choice of fields for the UK. (Asking me my London borough as a required field, rather than London).  Then when my new razer blade laptop comes with the lancer wireless mouse... wireless mode doesn't work at all and the mouse back lifts up so i can see the bare circuit board... after a few ""did you try turning it on"" emails.... they agree to send me a new one, after I send have to send the broken one back.... by printing a fedx label... in a rude email with a million caveats say it will probably be a referb. Who prints anything these days? I don't have a printer... why do I have to wait?  This company is all marketing hype and poor deliver / customer experience. The mouse had terrible reviews anyways.

"I would like to share my experience that I had with the Razerzone store. I have always been faithful and have had great luck with their laptops, but I will no longer be purchasing anything from them online. Upon trying to get a new Razer Blade laptop from them with the mano'war and backpack promotion, four days had passed without any shipping confirmation. I was then contacted by Razer support as they asked for my ID and banking statement to confirm my identity, as my shipping and billing address did not match. This seemed strange as I had never had an issue like this at an online store before. I sent them the info over email, but blurred the important parts. After a confirmation from them a week passed without word, still in the review process. I became very worried about my own security, as the email I sent it to was via ""salesforce"". A legitimate business, but worrying none the less. I tried contacting them via email, phone (which led no where and was hung up on several times), and finally Razer online chat. It was at that time I noticed the money I had paid had been deposited back into my account. After talking with Razer chat, I was reassured about my security and told I may have to place the order again. I was also told the order was in process, but again, no confirmation, and no shipping info. I finally got a hold of their main office in Irvine to get some answers, but again, hung up on multiple times. I finally had enough, and requested that I be called regarding my order or I would cancel it. I got a phone call from a blocked number, and was assured several times that as far as they were concerned, they had my money, there was nothing to worry about, and the order was on its way. A day later, they cancel the order for the same reason this all started ""Both fields must be physical address."" Fair enough. However, the following day, they take the full amount out of my bank account. I have not recieved any proof of credit or refund, and am now in the process with my bank to dispute the claim, because I have not received my money, or product. What a frustrating set of weeks.",english,razer,Joe Reid,1,2017-08-30T17:15:05.000+00:00,Frustrations galore,1
"On August 12th, 2017 I signed up for Razer's mailing list to receive a $10 off coupon.  A few moments later an email arrives from Razer entitled, Welcome to Razer, content which says, ""Use the below code at checkout: None Available""  That's odd for a coupon code.  I had the headset in my shopping cart - which, by the way, I needed to keep re-adding since every time I navigated away from the shopping cart page the contents were expunged.  I tried entering the code ""None Available"" in for a coupon code. The website displayed the following text in red, Invalid Voucher. I'm not getting anywhere.  I opened support case 01294633 to ask for a new coupon code as I had requested and was promised.  I received a nice response with coupon code L08-XTW9-KCGW-GGP2.  True to my word, Razer having fulfilled my request for $10 off I (once again) re-added the headset to my shopping cart and provided my payment information.  I receive an email shortly there-after confirming that order number RZUSWP00000006657752 has been initiated. Less than 5 minutes later I receive a follow-up which says, quote, ""We are glad to let you know that we have successfully processed your order and are preparing your order for shipment.  If you paid by credit card, your credit card has now been charged.""  That was all August 12th.  I am waiting for three days before I check the status of my order.  Apparently Razer charged my credit card without shipping the goods.  ""According to the Federal Trade Commission, many credit card issuers do not allow merchants to charge your credit card before they ship.""  This was not a pre-authorization request or a temporary hold on my card but they actually took my money at this point without shipping my headphones.  The headphones never shipped. On August 17th I received an email which says, quote, "" Hello Guest,""... Guest?  Apparently I was reduced to guest status.  The email continues, ""Your cancellation request has been submitted. ""  Cancellation? What cancellation?  I've already paid for the headphones and am anxious awaiting shipping for the past 5 days.  I open a new case with Razer support number 01302219.  On August 18th I receive an email saying, ""We have processed your order refund.""  I don't want a refund.  I want my headphones.  I open a new case, 01294633 to inquire once again what's going on.  I receive a response to case number 01302196 on August 18th with the explanation, ""the shipping address was identified as a freight forwarding address by our system thus the order was cancelled.""  A couple of things. no, it's not a ""freight forwarding address"" and second,  How about a phone call or email to put the order on hold while I explain to you that I use The UPS Store to receive packages, especially electronics, to protect them from thieves snatching my packages off my door step during the day. The UPS Store does not forward packages. They sign for packages, keep them locked up, and then I sign for them when I retrieve it from them.  The email continues, ""Please be advised, for the order to be placed successfully on our webstore, kindly use a physical USA address when placing the order.""  Physical USA address?  The UPS Store is right there on Main Street.  I sent them a Google Street View image showing the store front in a small shopping center.  This is a physical USA address - there it is!  It's a red sign behind the truck, next to the pizza place.  It is not some virtual address or a forwarding address.  Razer writes back in response to case 01302219 asking me to only respond to case 01302196 which would put me further back in the support response queue.  I write to respond to case 01302196, telling Razer what I think of them and their inability to ship to me after they charged my credit card.  I receive a response back from case 01294633 by phone.  I'm getting lost as to what case we're on.  I write back to Razer, tell them to keep their headphones, tell them there are plenty of competitors, and advise them that I have written to the top executives at The UPS Store to inform them that Razer won't do business with them.  and, neither will I being doing business with Razer anymore.  I have also filed a complaint with Chase Visa against Razer who charged my credit card without shipping my headphones.",english,razer,Henri,2,2017-08-30T15:51:10.000+00:00,Hostile Towards Their Customers,1

"I'm so sorry to hear that a lot of people had terrible experiences with Razer. For me, I just purchased The New Razer Blade (Late 2016) from their website, my first ever Razer product and everything was fine. Better yet, their support services were fantastic for me. At the time of purchase I had JUST missed out on a new bonus code where you get a free pair of Kraken Pro V2 headphones and the Lancehead mouse with your purchase of a Razer Blade. I was so bummed that I missed out that I emailed Razer support asking if there was a chance I could still have the two free products. Support services were great with consistent and reliable contact that took 1-2 days for each reply. Even with my gazillion questions, they answered me patiently and thoroughly, made sure my case was taken care of. I got my laptop a week after purchase, got the headphones 2 weeks after and now I'm waiting on the mouse. I really wasn't expecting such generosity so I am pleasantly surprised they were totally okay with sending me the two products both worth just under 400 dollars together, completely for free even after I had missed out on entering a code at the time of purchasing the Razer Blade.

I got a product and it didn't work, so a day or two after I got the product and tested it I submitted a Return form. Every time they try their best to make it so you can't return it. They will keep asking questions about the item and then wait two days to respond. Then when it gets past 14 days they say too bad and that it's past the return period. Both times for me the product didn't work. I said that in my return form. They emailed the first time asking for more info, then the second time they called on an anonymous caller number and left a message. It said they aren't willing to give me a return number until I answer more questions. Then I answered the question and specified what is wrong. They try to make you go through troubleshooting, but if it's not working once it will likely have problems in the future so I always ask for a return. They will not give a return without making you troubleshoot. Or at least they didn't for me.

As a business I am entitled to claim this tax back from the UK government but I cannot without a compliant VAT invoice. After 5 days all I get from Razer is that they cannot give me their VAT registration details. A simple google search supplies me with them and all I need is for them to write this number on the PDF invoice as they are legally required to do. All that is happening is I am getting stonewalled by customer support. I assume that Razer is not involved in an elaborate tax scam so that only leaves incompetence.

"HORRIBLE experience at Razer.de . My girlfriend ordered a Razer Diamondback mouse end of November 2016 to receive it for my birthday in the beginning of December. It never came and customer service had no idea where it was. So she thought she'd give it to me for Christmas. Never came. Customer service could not give us any information. So I asked for a refund. I sent so many emails, and just got the same type of response every time, I called so many times and they did not really know what was going on and just said they will handle it etc. etc. No helpful info whatsoever about where the package was, or what happened or how long the refund will take, nothing. She finally received her refund 3 months after she put in the order.  And finally today I will return the mouse to the shop where we bought it ourselves, because of the scroll that slips.

"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Expect Incompetence.   I tried to order a laptop, made a small typo in my address. Reached out to customer service to see if they could fix it: they said ""yes, we'll confirm when it's done"". Next day, I check my emails and my order was cancelled.   I reach out to customer service, they say that they can't change an address after an order has been placed so they had to cancel... Ok, I guess.  The worst part is that they had actually charged the full amount (&gt;$3k to my credit card before cancelling. So now the funds are frozen for the next 24-48hours. ""Fine, I'll wait and re-order with the correct address"".  Jump ahead 2 days. Funds are unblocked. I place my order again. Check my CC online: funds are charged. ""Yes! this is going to work!"".   Next day, check my emails: they cancelled my order, AGAIN!   Reach out to CS, they say they need a photoID with my address (they had never mentioned this in my previous interactions with CS). Then, they'll need to have the CC department validate the purchase so it'll take another 2-3 days  + the expected 2-3 days before it ships, AND they charged my CC again before cancelling. So I need to wait for the funds to unblock (+2 days).  tl-dr: Tried to order a laptop. Spent 2-3 hours talking to their CS, was given inconsistent information by their staff, best they could do was cancel my order twice without warning, make me wait 6 to 8 day before my order ships, after already having waited for 4 days.

"On March 26th, 2017 I have purchased a Razer Blade laptop from the Razer Store. Next day i was able to find same laptop at the Microsoft store in Canada for less, plus no need to pay customs duties. Also when buying from MS store you are eligible to get 4 year accidental warranty on your laptop, when buying from Razer you can only get one year extra for the same price.  I contacted Razer Sales to get my order cancelled, but i received this instead:  "" Hi, Maksim.   We are sorry that we are no longer able to cancel your order at this time as the order has already been processed.   Our warehouse works really fast. This is an awesome feat but in your case it is not.   You will receive a tracking information in a separate email so you can monitor and refuse the package when it arrives.   If you are not able to reject the package and would still like to return the item/s, please reply to this e-mail within 14 days from the delivery date (as per courier tracking number) with your product serial number/s and we can provide you an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) Number and the return instructions. The postage fee will be shouldered by you.   Please do not manually return the package without an RMA number.   In the mean time, please review our Returns Policy for more helpful information.   Thank you for your time and understanding. Have a pleasant day.   Sincerely,  Team RazerStore""  Oh well, if you can't then you can't. I e-mailed them back asking what is the best way to deal with all that, they e-mailed me back suggesting to reject the package upon received. Ok, did exactly what they said. I rejected the package. The package has been received by them on April 6th (i have a confirmation e-mail). Then i asked how long it will take for me to get my money back. They replied to me saying that it will take UP TO 14 business days. If you know math you can easily calculate that. So i should have seen my money back in my account on April 26th. Today is May 10th, 2017 and i still haven't seen my money back. Then i called them, as you guys know, when you call Razer, you get to talk to their tech support team, and there is no freaking way you can talk to sales (Wow really?). Poor tech support guys, they have to deal with all unhappy customers, must be the worst job ever. And all they do when you complain, they say: ""unfortunately i'm the tech support person, and have limited access to billing"". I will send an e-mail to sales, to escalate that... RAZER REALLY, THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS?   So, anyways, after calling and e-mailing them for a while i get another e-mail from Orders support:  ""Hi Maksim,  Good day and thank you for reaching out to RazerStore Support. My name is Jay and I hope this email finds you well.  About your refund status, I have reviewed your case and it seems like your refund should reflect in your account on 2nd May 2017 depending on your banking institution.   I hope this helps. For now I will leave this case open until I get a confirmation from you to close this ticket. Please don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything that we missed or is/are confusing in this email.    I will be here to be on a lookout for your case and you do have a wonderful day.

Called Razer support on May 2nd again... Poor tech support agent. He had to listen to all my complains and concerns....  After half hour phone call, my case was escalated... 5 mins after i hang up the phone, i got another e-mail from Jay from Orders saying that the refund has been processed and it will take 3-5 days to reflect in my bank account. Ok, if you do math again May 3rd + 3-5 days will be May 6th - 8th... Guess what, May 10th, still haven't received my refund...   I did call my bank and disputed the transaction. The bank said if i don't get my refund back within several days from Razer, they will deal with Razer themselves.   This is my story... Very sad, that i have to put 1 star (i wish they had 0 star).

"I am buying a Razer Blade from the Razer website.   I have some Razer items (mouse, headphones) which I had bought from other stores previously and always liked. I am aware of the brand as I do a lot of gaming, and i have been looking for a gaming laptop for a little while. Always thought Razer products are a bit over priced but I decided to get the Razer Blade after much back and forth between that and other products. The blade is ¬£1800 and given I was spending almost ¬£2000 on a laptop I was expecting quite a premium service. They always seem to sell themselves as such a premium product that I assumed that this would be the case. I was wrong.   Firstly, i find their website quite confusing and irritating but maybe that is just me. I decided on the Full HD version and the 256MB SSD configuration. It said that it was in stock, or at least I assumed it was because when you click on others instead of 'buy now' or equivalent it said 'notify me' so I assumed that it would be shipped immediately. The page said, under the heading of 'Shipping' and under it (the only option) 'Express (1-4 business days)' Now I may just be silly, but I took 1-4 days to mean this document will take 1-4 days to arrive from order. Actually it means it will take 1-4 days to be shipped and then it will take however long it takes to arrive.   There is no link to the shipping info page on the website when you are checking out and I eventually found it having ordered. It says there that if its in stock it will take up to 3 business days to ship. It has now been 4 days and it has still not shipped.   I went into the tracking system and it has a very helpful tool bar telling you the status of your order. It also estimates the time your order will spend at each stage of the process (the site is currently down so I cant tell you exactly what they are names but there are 4 stages). I can tell you that the processing stage is estimated to take 24 hours, it has currently been stuck there for 3 days.   Now I am not in a rush, but equally I am always pretty impatient when I am getting a new toy and i want to play with it! This is worse when its an expensive one, I really want to get my hands on this thing. I would not care if they made it clear from the start how long things would take, or even if they were unclear (i dont see why they couldnt be accurate with their timings) but to tell you one thing one one page (will be shipped in 1-4 days), and tell you a completely different thing on another page (in stock items will be shipped in 3 days), and then a completely different thing on another page (items will be processed in 24 hours) and for  none of them to be the case is very frustrating.   I was really hoping to have this before the weekend when I ordered it, when I finally found the shipping page a couple of days later I lowered my expectations that it would be shipped before the weekend and then arrive before the next weekend. Now I am genuinely concerned that I am not going to get this for another two weeks. Next weekend is a bank holiday and I was really hoping to have it before then but I dont think I will now.   These are all relatively trivial but equally, had I really needed this I would have been in a bit of a situation because they are completely incapable of telling you what time things will arrive, and yet make it look like they know which makes it worse. ¬£1800 is a lot of money for me to spend on anything, let alone a laptop and frankly this process is really taking the shine off of it.   Personally, if I was working at a company which seems to base its brand on being premium and delivering high quality products I would also consider that the buying process forms such an important part of the buyers experience.   I haven't even received my laptop now, I fully expect it to be excellent and obviously hope I am right but if Razer need any help in developing a proper customer service procedure in future befitting their brand then I am very happy to tell you what 'good' looks like. I have ordered computers from other websites previously and always had brilliant experiences (PC Specialist if you are interested, are brilliant and excellent at communicating throughout even unprompted).",english,razer,Ashley Wilson,4,2017-04-11T13:25:21.000+00:00,No idea when things will arrive/be sent and their website is no help.,2
"Customer Service was absolute trash I sent in my laptop to fix an issue with the keyboard lighting. I am a computer engineer so I did quite a bit of troubleshooting. They requested a note describing the issue I did explicitely along with how to test if the issue was resolved. They did not give me a status on my order or what was owrked on for days. By the time they did reply with how they ""fixed"" my laptop it was already being shipped back. They actually sited that they re-imaged the OS funny thing is that I told them that I already did that.  Ok fine maybe they tested it and that did magically fix it even though I tried that about 7x before sending the laptop in for repair. So I receive the package and take it out of the box within about 30 seconds it is apparent it was not fied. At this point I am not sure that they did any work at all. At this point they asked me to send the laptop back so that it woudl be gone another week. I use this laptop for work I dont have time to send this thing back just for it to get sent back and not resolved. So they say ok we will do advanced replacement but we have to place a pending hold on your credit card.  I am like wll that is really annoying but ok. So they charge me $999 not pending actually charged me over a week ago.  The refurbished laptop that they are sending me costs $749 so that is ridiculous.  I can not describe the level of incompetence and the lack of customer service here.  This laptop was supposed to be sent overnight over a week ago I have called these guys maybe 20x over the month course of this trash. I have never had such a back experience in my life with a store of any type. I bought this from the company site thinking that this sort of thing would be less likely to happen. I still do not have the replacement that $999 charge has been on my credit card over a week accruing interest for over a week on something that I had actually already bought.

"I ordered a new Razer Blade mid January from RazerStore GB. The website suggested it would be dispatched same day. However it did not shipping till one week later. I was charged for the whole price on ordering and AGAIN when the laptop shipped. Therefore I had close to ¬£4000 taken from my account. Razer Order support said one of the charges was an authorisation hold and it would return in a few days. It took over TWO WEEKS to be returned. This was not from a credit card so placed me under financial strain. Razer know about this but have failed to acknowledge it.   When the laptop did dispatch I was sent a FedEx tracking number. I was told by Razer support it would be shipped from the Netherlands, but the shipping clearly said from Hong Kong. It arrived in the UK about a day and a half later but then failed to be delivered on the day FedEx's tracking. FedEx have then taken over a week to try and find it and have come back today saying they can't find it. I assume it's either lost or been stolen. Now I have to go back to Razer support (who take SEVERAL DAYS to respond to each email and only seem to selectively respond to emails) and see what they can do about it. Their website has a phone number for European customers but whenever I ring, no-one picks up or it says number does not exist. This is extremely poor.   I'm absolutely fed up with being charged twice (Razer is at fault for this) and having my laptop not delivered and likely lost/stolen (FedEx is at fault for this).

"I made an order on 6th of november. Mouse, headphones, mouse pad and 3 more cheap items for a total of almost 200 euros. Checked my order and it was saying that they dont have the mouse pad until the 15th of november, and they only deliver when they have all the items in stock. Ok, it's pretty understandable, I said I'll be patient, nothing I can do about it. On the 15th of november they still didn't ship my order. I waited 2 more days, and on the 17th of november they bloody edited the dates, and said they don't have the mouse pad available till 30th of november. So I send them an e-mail on the 17th, asking for my money back cause I had enough waiting without them even letting me know. No message, no phone call, no e-mail, nothing. They still didn't answer until today, I'm still waiting for an aswer. I just got an automated e-mail when I made the refund request and that's all. Complete joke!

Their point, was that it was impossible to get a 2012 model to replace mine. Tried arguing with them that it was not something that should penalized me and that Razer was gonna replace it for them anyway..  to no Avail...   BAD!

"I preordered the New Razer Blade, I was so excited to get this however....I really hate their so called 'policy' where they only take payments the day they ship it, this was a problem for me because my bank has a budget policy where I can only spend 1500$ within 24 hours unless I call them and tell them to raise the budget, however it can only last for 2-3 days it sucks :/......I even contacted Razer to let them know however they didn't even bother taking it as information nor did they do anything about it. It was suppose to get shipped on the 18th of May but they delayed it to the 27th of May which was a big disappointment but I was willing to wait anyways and got a 50$ coupon for it so I kept quiet.  When it was almost the 27th I called my bank and they told me that Razer attempted to take my money but the bank declined.  I didn't get any emails NOTHING from Razer about taking my money not even a ""Oh sorry your card was declined."" I did tell my bank to raise the budget and after that I emailed Razer about it and waited for 2 F***ING days just to get a response!!!  Today I got a response from them and guess what!? They said ""Oh we apologize but we cancelled your order."" REALLY!? Razer didn't tell me about any of this sh**!!!! I had to contact Razer support in order to know about THIS!!!!!!! I literally sent them back an emailed persisting them to get a manager or someone who is responsible and try to work it out. F*** RAZER!!!!!

"Purchased Razer Lycosa special edition Gaming Keyboard after about a months it just started randomly turning off when playing games contacted support through email (only way). they replied asking if i had receipt said yes i purchased it from amazon/ebay (can't remember now). After I sent them the info they asked if i wanted to RMA or cut the cord take a picture of it and the serial and they will send new one and that way is faster so I cut the cord sent the info they replaced the board. Thinking that everything was good and great support when I received my board worked great for about 2 months than it started doing the same thing contacted them again they asked if i had a receipt and i told them no I don't because you sent me this board they tried to look up my info that they used to have and then contacted me and said there has never been such a case and that they never did that return and then continued to tell me to quit trying to get free swag.

"My first venture into the PC gaming world; what a terrible experience. Son needed a left handed mouse and Razer seemed to be only option. Got that through UK retailer OK. Made sense to go for a Razer keyboard. Razerzone were ¬£125, ¬£25 cheaper than UK retailers, plus free delivery. Website said limited availability, put the order through and got email acknowledgement with 4 day delivery. 10 minutes later, another saying now on backorder. Tried to contact, but only option is through email on website. Looked at warranty papers for mouse and saw that if an item is purchased through Razerzone, it has to be returned to Singapore. I see previous reviews had to return to Germany, at some expense, so there seems little point in purchasing direct from the manufacturer, who has no UK office or telephone contact to deal with any issues.

I feel there are no words left other than to say, if after this sternly worded review you are still foolish enough to purchase ANYTHING from them directly then more fools you! There are other vendors of their products. Don't go direct as their total lack of infrastructure and supply chain is the main issue in getting the goods. Good luck to anyone still waiting on goods.

"I ordered my partner a Nabu back in November for Christmas which came with a free Nabu X for your friend. The Nabu didn't fit my partner so I emailed Razer to see if I could exchange for a bigger size, they said absolutely send it back to Germany. They didn't mention about giving the free one back so we just sent the Nabu back for exchange. It cost ¬£9.14 for us to send it back to Germany and when they received it they said they were now out of stock of the bigger size but they would give us a code to use online on the website at the value of the band excluding tax!!  Please see quoted their email:   'We are out of stock of your product and as such we would like to offer you a promo code to our online store instead. You can use the promo towards the purchase of almost any item on the Razerzone website. The promo code will have a value that is equal to your original purchase price (tax excluded) and we also include free standard shipping.'   I emailed back on the same day which was the 7th December saying that I would accept the code but on the 12th I still hadn't  received a response, so I emailed saying as I haven't heard anything please can I have a refund. On the 14th they said sorry for the delay they will see about getting a refund. It wasn't until the 16th they emailed saying that they could only partially refund me as I didn't send back the FREE band. On the 17th I said to them I am more than willing to send back the free band if they wanted to cover the delivery cost but they replied saying they wouldn't cover the cost. I emailed them back on the 20th saying that it was too much hassle for me to return it please can I have the code, and finally today on the 28th they have responded with a code for only ¬£45 which has to be used today. ¬£45!!!

"Razer is a good example of a largely overrated company with consistently underwhelming products. I have purchased from them 5 items: Mamba &amp; Death Adder mice; Carcharias headset; Arctosa keyboard and a set of leatherette cushions for the Carcharias headphones. Three of those products malfunctioned or stopped working altogether within 12 months, but I'm here to single out the most aggravating of all of those purchases: The Razer Ear Cushion Leatherette. The leatherettes are a pair of cushions made of a leather-looking, black, soft plastic material that can be used interchangeably on a wide range of headgears from the Razer line. They are very soft to the touch and truly comfortable. The first problem I encountered was the design of the locking mechanism. Placing them on the Carcharias headphones was neither smooth nor easy. The second problem was the appalling and entirely unacceptable quality of the leatherette material. On the second day after I started using them the cushions began to peel and flake. From then on it was all a constant downward spiral until they looked like the mangiest doughnuts. I discontinued their use within just two weeks. It was not so much the look of the things, but the fact that black plastic flakes kept getting into my ears. It's a shame I cannot post photographs of the sorry things. My advice? If you feel you must own a Razer product, keep to the mice, those are the only things that seem to work adequately.
