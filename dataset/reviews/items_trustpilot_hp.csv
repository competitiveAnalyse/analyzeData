"dict","I ordered a sale desktop PC and monitor from hp.com. they originally said it would take one month to build and ship it. it has been over 1 month and it has not been built yet. I called and asked them to cancel the order and they said they cannot cancel it until after they build it. This makes no sense to me because I no longer want the desktop. To make matters worse they shipped the monitor to me separately but their website says that it was not shipped. I will not be ordering from HP again.","review","english","HP","Jon Beck","1","2018-12-03T17:50:17.000+00:00","I ordered a sale desktop PC and monitor…","1"

"dict","Hewlett-Packard reneged on Black Friday order   My new laptop ordered was confirmed early Black Friday morning (Nov. 23), with estimated shipping date of Dec. 4th. The sales price was about $150 before tax. However, by evening time, HP unilaterally canceled my order per their email below. Any so-called pricing error was on HP’s side. Any good Black Friday deals are gone after the whole day, a $50 coupon does not remedy the situation. HP is utterly untrustworthy and irresponsible. Since this incident, I did some research and found that a few years ago, Michigan state sued HP for its failure to deliver on a $49 million contract. Over the years, HP unilaterally canceled other consumers' orders too, so HP has a history of reneging on its obligations.      --------- From Cto-esc Hpshopping  Nov. 23, 2018  We made a mistake! Unfortunately, we experienced an error with our pricing today on the HP 17z which resulted in your order being cancelled.  We are very sorry and hope you will come back to our site and place a new order for this laptop which will be available tomorrow at its correct price or you can shop now for many other amazing Black Friday deals on great HP tech today through next week. Please visit our website to reorder.  Your original order has been refunded. The refund will reflect on your payment account depending on your bank’s processing time – typically 3 to 5 business days from cancellation.  You will receive a cancellation email to confirm.

"dict","NOT gonna believe this.... HP has absolutely ridiculous products and customer service.   Please think twice before you spend big.  I own two HP laptops so far, and my first one had problems with a crack (which was my fault and not to be blamed to HP). Problem really happened when I contacted HP for the repair and they told me to put my laptop in the box they sent me thru mailing (DO NOT TRUST EM WITH UR LAPTOP LIKE THAT).   The head of the head supervisor, called me a few days later saying I will have product seems like water damaged product and therefore they cannot fix. WHICH WAS FINE. So I just told em to return my laptop, so I can get my local repairman to do the job.   And what do I know???? I receive my laptop back to a completely garbage, broken down state to the point, now I just had to trash the laptop. It seems like they opened some parts for water damage status, and didn't even bother reassemble up to the state it was sent in to them. Just bunch of broken parts of laptop, a wire coming out of laptop; the state my laptop was in was unbelievable. It turned from a laptop, that needs a quick fix to something I can't even recognize what happened to it. (TOTALLY BROKEN)   What's more funny is that, it is clearly not dropped or anything (from shipping); rather quite obvious it was torn apart and broken by the inspector, but staffs keep coming up with different story staff by staff saying anything from (we didnt do that to something like ""we opened it but the water damage was there so we cannot help you"") and in the end, THEY DIDNT EVEN HELP ME WITH MY SITUATION. They were just like ""Are you done? Can you kindly ff off"" attitude from both supervisor and other lower staffs. I had to explain my situation to Costco and they felt so bad for my experience, they just refunded my product without spending 5 min explaining. No help from HP whatsoever.  AND NOW I somehow had another HP laptop, which had me replacing my THREE 1TB internal Hard disks because the laptop keeps breaking (eating up) my HDD.   Later, I found out that the fan overheating, frequent breakdown of hard disk is very common problem within HP laptops and people have had experience of replacing HDD every 2 weeks or so before they all gave up in the end.. I called HP and they are saying I habe to pay for the service that they poorly built in the first place?? I really don't even expect a refund or free repair, but should really have put me with free check-in or troubleshooting for the structural failure issue...  Is HP company a joke? Not professional in any aspect of this company.   I really appreciate those who took time to read my review and hope you really really think twice before buying ANY of HP product.   Thank you.","review","english","HP","Jay","1","2018-11-18T02:48:45.000+00:00","NOT gonna believe this....","1"

"dict","Even as the last option HP proves they're not worth it.  HP customer service is by far the worst service I have experienced. I bought a gaming laptop (pavilion gtx1050 i5 intel core), and the device stored working a week from day of delivery. I rung hp to get assistance, no one could help cause systems were down so they sid they'd call me back. 24 hrs later I rung and they offer to fix my device of which i refused cause it'd only been a week so I did I wasn't a refund. I was passed on from post-sales team to tech team well over 7 times and had to explain my story each time I spoke to an apparent assistant. They finally said they'd call me back. Another 24 hours later, I called them and I was transferred through to a guy who worked for some company contacted by hp to handle calls if there's a high number of call... Hey said he'll email then and they will call me back and again no call for 48 hours so guess what... I rung and only to be told that I had been put through to the wrong section. I purchased the laptop for business purposes but I was top that the laptop I got was not under my business account so the team that was to deal with this was just the normal consumer products department so I had to explain again.    They took all the details down and said I should give them 72 hours to check what they can do of which I re-emphasised I just want my money back. They did not call back but rather they emailed with info that the laptop woild be collected and I'd receive an email from the courier (DPD in this case). As nother email pops through saying the funds will be back in my account within 8 days (26th Oct 18). On the 30th the laptop got collected and delivered by the 31st (tracked and signed).  I check my account and nothing has been sent back to my account. I email them on the (7th Nov 18) and they reply saying my refund is still being processed. Today is the 13th Nov 18, almost a week later still nothing. I called only to be told ""We are sorry for the delay, the accounts team had some sort of issue and they only approved your refund yesterday so your funds will be with you by the end of the week or so...""  2018... Like seriously.  Keep in mind that this is the 2nd HP laptop that had just stored working for no reason. It simply ran out of power, i plugged it in and turned it on and saw a repair screen... then an option to restart the device or select another action (tried all options and none worked even when on the phone with hp).  The first laptop just didn't turn on one day and that was it and what was annoying is that it'd only been 1 year 3 days from day of purchase.   After all this, all one gets is Sorry without any compensation at all.  I really detest hp laptops and I think I'll just move on to a different windows laptop manufacturer (already have an iMac).  I am glad I hadn't downloaded any of my music software otherwise they'd have tried pinning it on that I'm sure.  Such terrible customer service I'd highly recommend against dealing with hp if one really has a choice. My mum's laptop has been for repair 3 times in 1 year (HP). My niece's laptop harddrive just stopped working and all you could see on the screen were multiple colours (hp)...  like seriously 👀","review","english","HP","Jerry Jaricha","3","2018-11-14T19:20:14.000+00:00","Even as the last option HP proves…","1"

"dict","HP printers are the absolute WORST!  I HATE my printer.  They have an automatic ink renewal program which sounds awesome on paper, but it costs more money in the long run.  They do these stupid little underhanded things that force you to print more pages, so they can bill you when you go over your limit.  Normally when you accidentally hit the print button, a printer will allow you to hit the 'cancel' button to stop an unnecessary print job.  No, not HP.  They make sure to screw you so they get their ink quota in.  I was recently away from home and accidentally sent a print job to my printer instead of the remote printer I was using. - It obviously didn't go to my printer since I was not in range,  so I sent the print job to the printer I was connected to at the other location and was on my merry way.  As soon as I got home and booted up my computer, it connected to my printer and started printing.  I hit the cancel button half way through the 20 page document.  It cancelled the current print job, then immediately fired up the queue again to print the whole 20 pages over again. I hit cancel again, then there goes the print queue again. I HIT CANCEL 10 FREAKING TIMES!!!!!! Every single time I hit cancel, it immediately fired up the print queue again. I was finally forced to give up and let the printer print the whole 20 pages I did not need it to print. So in the end 30 pages of paper were wasted and 30 pages worth of ink that I am getting billed for wasted.

"dict","On July 25, 2017, I contact HP Support service concerning an Envy I purchase and just taking the computer from the packing content I could not get the computer to connect to my Home WIFI. I spent the day requesting for a refund and to return the Envy computer system. I contact them on FB as well as Twitter and no one returned my request. I should have pursued the refund policy and return the product to them as reading all the negative comments concerning their products and customer service. However, after numerous phone calls, I finally reach a support member who helps me connect the system to my WIFI. But the problem now I have a warranty on the computer which is still into effect as of July 4th of 2020. During the conversation with the HP Support team, I specifically told her my Warranty Agreement was still activated and she repeated the policy verbatim. I gave her the Case number twice and twice she ((Preikana) stated she could not retrieve the information! But within the same sentence, she stated she retrieve the information and proceed to give me instructions on how I should return the computer for repairs. First issue the Hard Drive and Second Issue reinstalling the operating system. Then after she explained the procedure thoroughly then her next statement was the option to have a technician sent to my home for $50. The second option was would take 3 - 4 for the completion of the repairs instead of two weeks process as option number 1! Which I was in favor of doing so and paying the $50 fee. But get this, after a long pause and waiting for her to take my credit card she returns to the phone stating I do not have a warranty in place and option 2 is not applicable for my case. What an idiot I stated to myself, this representative shows how HP needs to cease operation. First of all, your representative has commented to me I do have a WARRANTY(CARE PACKAGE EFFECTIVE UNTIL 4TH OF JULY 2020)  and now your representative is stating because I do not have an active warranty I cannot activate Option 2 for the home repair utilizing the technician to come to my home. What type of practice is HP  operating? A customer offers revenue for services and your Support Representative refuses the customer for lack of customer service skills. Please someone with consumer affair reads these reviews and help us close down this operation and all individuals requesting refund be given a full refund for products not working and or still under warranty. I am utilizing all media to voice my reviews about HP and Support representation. I would have given a negative rating if I could have done so! In summary - NEVER - NEVER BUY HP  PRODUCTS AGAIN!","review","english","HP","Grace Deen","3","2018-10-18T08:05:19.000+00:00","Warranty Effective until 4th July 2020!","1"
"dict","I have bought this Hp laptop a month ago, It has accidentally broken, so sensitive the screen is,  When I contacted service center for the repair, when i took the laptop to the service center, The center took a week to send the quotation, which when accepted , it was 2 weeks ago, still now, no update on the product or when the repair will be done.   Dear HP,      We have bought this laptop to use, not to keep it in your service center for ages, If you do not have the stock of the spares or cannot tell how much time it will require to repair, why on earth are you still in business and making our life miserable.  What's the use of buying a laptop if that's not of any use , and still paying my EMIs for the laptop. This is completely disastrously bad.   I sincerely recommend others to be aware of the worst servicing that the company have and don't  spend your hard earned money in this risky purchases.","review","english","HP","Kotesh Javvaji","1","2018-10-18T05:50:08.000+00:00","Worst HP Customer Service","1"

"dict","The hard drive failed on my HP Notebook 17 that is less than 2 years old. I had the HP Care service package. My experience with customer service has been EXTREMELY disappointing -- the reps set expectations that 1) they don't record; 2) they know there is no way it is going to happen the way they said; 3) they have no respect for the time the customer is in limbo; and 4) they appear to have no options for ""customer recovery/retention"" (e.g., a coupon for a discount on HP printer cartridges as one way to say ""so sorry""). I'd suggest training in truth-telling and an investment in better product development.  I will be purchasing a new laptop that is not from HP. I hope to use my HP Notebook as a back up but it and the support systems are not reliable enough to depend on for day-to-day use.

They have the least reliability and the MFP 426 I have has convinced me to go to another manufacturer and leave after 20 years of buying HP small office printers.

"dict","PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ORDERING ANYTHING FROM HP ON THEIR WEBSITE!  I made the mistake of reading reviews on this site and thinking that nothing bad could happen to my order, and I was horribly mistaken. I have never encountered such terrible customer service and an awfully organised team.  I ordered a HP Omen desktop which costs £1270 on September the 17th which was promised with 48-hour delivery, in the UK if this order is made before 4pm it is likely to deliver the next working day, which sounded great and was a better deal than anywhere on the high street, or any other website. An estimated delivery date stated that I would get my PC on 19th September according to their website. Before ordering, I read everything regarding their delivery and return policies, and it stated I was to receive a text in the evening to let me know that my product was in transit and what time it would be arriving.   So I placed my order and waited until the evening, and didn't get any text. I checked the website and my order had processed and was in Shipping status and they had my money, so I gave it another day as it said it could take 48 hours to arrive. Another day passes, no text, and my order  so I was extremely worried about what was happening to my parcel. Their email is useless which staff will direct you to, im not allowed to post it but its a post sales hp account, you can try your luck as it might be a lot cheaper than the second option. It took ages to find the relevant number to contact HP UK Customer Service on mobile, so I will place it here if anyone needs it: 0843 837 5538. ***BEFORE CALLING THIS NUMBER, JUST SO YOU KNOW YOU WILL BE CHARGED EXTORTIONATELY AS I HAVE JUST SEEN MY BILL AND BEEN CHARGED £54 EXTRA ON TOP OF MY CONTRACT FOR ALL THE CALLS I MADE, TOTALLING TO 32 CALLS**** I remember selecting options 2, 3, and 1 for anyone whos given the options as if memory serves me well, it leads to the customer service for PC support, (obviously it depends on your situation and what you ordered). Basically, my PC hadn't shipped for the same reason everyone states on here, which is a ""massive technical error"". The first person who picked up told me about it and apologised profusely and it was working to be resolved. No dispatch notification that night again. 20th September arrives I check my order and for some reason my order now says WAITING STOCK, so I phone the team again so they redirected me to post sales which is where a lot of false promises and claims were made about my product, and caused me to make those 32 calls etc. I got redirected to a man who is frequently mentioned in these reviews who again described the technical issue to me and that they will be fixing it today (Thursday 20th), and are going through the orders manually, and my order might dispatch tonight or if failing that, on Monday as they don't do orders on the weekend. I asked if this could be hurried up as it was already 19th September and after spending all this money I wanted my order when promised, and he couldn't contact anyone in their team sorting out dispatches which is incredibly odd and frustrating. This was so annoying for me as I wanted my order now.   There were alot of calls back to check on my product as there was no update, and after being constantly let down, I decided to cancel my order as it had not been dispatched after 5 days of my order being placed, and it was just easier for me to go down the road and buy it from a retailer. I cancelled the order on Thursday night after reading most of these reviews of the horror stories of HP's customer service, and the next day I receive an email ""my query is being processed and the team would get back to me"" but my order has basically NOT been cancelled. I called again so I could speed the process up, was put on hold for 20 minutes which cost me £10 in itself, and a different man (I apologise for not remembering names) said he has now cancelled my order and an email confirming that would be sent through. I get the email minutes later and it says: We are writing to confirm that we have received and are actively processing your request to cancel your HP Store order.  We will do everything possible to cancel your order prior to shipping but on occasion we may not be able to support this request as the goods have already moved into shipping status.   I didn't want anything to do with this company and I just wanted my order to be stopped. So I look on the website, and my product is still in waiting stock status?!? I call back and they put me through to post sales again and I am answered by Aida, who promised me to get everything done and she would do everything in her power to stop my product from shipping today. I hung up the phone, but then I rang again because I had a few queries regarding this ""promise"" so I phone again and am put on phone for another 20 minutes £10, and I am put onto Sara, who has been the only person to help me in this abysmal company. She told me everything that has happened and stated they couldn't really tell me anything regarding my product as it is with their shipping team, and they are unable to contact them, and I tell her that Aida promised me to cancel my order. Sara says she doesn't know why Aida did that because their team have no access to that level of power, and cannot really do anything. So basically, Aida gave me a false promise. I asked a few more queries surrounding my product and how I was really angry about constantly being lied to and promised things. Sara gave me her personal HP address, and I asked her to email me there and then with it because I was tired at this point. She did while on the phone, and explained that she had to reply to my emails in the order that her emails are recieved but that she would get to my responses soon, which for me was much better than trying my luck with their post-sales address. She explained about if the product ships, that I should decline the parcel from the courier and that I should email her telling her immediately.  Luckily, they actually did cancel my order on Tuesday the 25th September, 8 days after me making my order...? I probably would have not received my order till god knows when if they had only just cancelled it then, and I luckily did get my refund around 2 days later, but I've read that some people haven't which is incredibly unfortunate.   So in summary, if you do have problems with ordering from HP, try to call them as little as possible to not get charged extortionately, write down any names you encounter and write down whatever they have said to you especially promises, also ask someone in post sales to give you their direct emails because their general email has been useless for me. Sara was the best one there so I really do recommend you ask for her, but that might cost you more time and money.   To be honest, do NOT order from here, just go anywhere else if you ever want to receive your order, and just save yourself time and money and go to Currys, or Amazon who have a far better customer reputation.","review","english","HP","Caitlin Hathaway","1","2018-10-02T10:03:24.000+00:00","PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ORDERING DIRECTLY FROM HP","1"

When I ordered a premium laptop it arrived faulty so I called customer service (1st call) and we went through fixing procedures and in the end was told to replace and expect a call the next day. No call so I called day after and was told they couldn't help so I had to then call postal service (3 calls now) which were quite unpleasant to talk to but they arranged a replacement. So once it was replaced the second one arrived and it was also faulty! Had to call again (4) and say I want to send it back and have a refund, so I got put through to postal services again (5) who told me to do it online. Of course, returning online was also a problem because of an 'invoice wasn't ready?' so I had to call back (6) and they had a series of internal calls to figure out why. Finally got a return arranged and a refund sorted, but wait... they sent back the refund only partially! So I had to call back (7) and now bear in mind I have to sit for about 10mins everytime listening to their static background music. Once I got through they also said there were a couple internal issues that caused my credit note to be wrong and they will send an email of a new credit note with the remaining amount after the call. They didnt send anything so I had to call for the EIGHT time until they fixed it and sent it back.

AS SOON as I started to use it problems started coming arise with the speakers with freezing etc. I contacted customer support and after long talk and various ways of trying to fix it, HP customer tech decided it was best for me to send in my laptop (past my 15 day return period so I could not return it). I made it very clear that I could not be without the laptop for more than a week due to being in school. He assured me that was NO ISSUE. That was septemer 17. It has been a week without my laptop and was supposed to expect it back september 26. Then I got a text saying HP product was delayed to october 2 and to call """" number if that was an issue. So I called the number and the customer service tech assured me that was wrong and that my laptop will be expected back september 26. Now it is September 24 and I got another text message saying my laptop is delayed to october 05 and to call if that was an issue. So I called and the customer tech said there was nothing she could do because i cold not talk to a supervisor because they were ""closing soon"" with 20 minutes until closing.

I know they have overpriced products that use cheap parts, and have laptops and PCs full of HP bloatware- but my main issues come down to their terrible support.   Honestly they may as well not exist. Go ahead to the website and pop in your Serial number. You will probably be met with something like 'You have 17 months left on your warranty. HP no longer support this product - go f*** yourself.  They make it stupidly difficult to speak to anyone on the website, opting to direct you to the support communities instead, which may as well be called 'figure it out amongst yourselves because we really don't give a s**t.'  When you do manage to speak to someone they are always condescending, which is a strange attitude to take when they don't know basic IT troubleshooting.   Prepare for them to go step by step with you through pointless crap before arriving at the conclusion you suggested to them 4 hours before.  Do you have a PC in front of you? Have you checked the plug? Is it turned on? Do you know how to log in?   Perhaps its because I work in IT and most of my experiences are coming to them needing parts for products still under warranty - I do all of the work and then turn up telling them how to fix it. But they still need to go through the goddamn checklist, and are reluctant to either send out parts or send out a technician. We don't pay for warranties so you can tell us to waste hours of our lives to reinstall this and that again and again.   Anyway clearly there is a pattern with these reviews.

"dict","I only had my 2in1 HP Pavilion laptop/tablet for a month or so and I was experiencing multiple issues with it. The product didn’t seamlessly change from laptop to tablet mode without it randomly changing the size of open windows and moving them around on the screen - you would also lose the ability to use the open applications properly and would have to restart to fix it. I was also having problems with the colour/brightness on the screen which would change whenever the screen was touched. The main problem I was having with the laptop was with the loud whirring noise it was making, which I was pretty sure was a hardware issue.   It was a weekend day, so I decided it was a good time to contact a HP technician and go through the issues with the laptop whilst in the comfort of my own home and with no time limitations. But I discovered that the opening hours to talk to a HP technician were Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 18:00. These hours mirrored my working hours so made it impossible for me to talk to a technician at home on my free time.   I waited until the Monday and contacted a HP technician on my lunch break. They asked me if I had the laptop in front of me and I said no, explaining that I work during the hours the helpline is open and that I don’t want to bring the laptop to work on a busy train. The technician understood this and gave me some instructions to update the BIOS and perform a system restore when I got home - I did this but it did not resolve my issues. I emailed the technician to tell them it hadn’t worked. In response they tried to ring me a couple of times but I was in work and couldn’t answer and was unable to ring them back after work because the helpline closes at 6pm. They did eventually email instead and asked for a recording of the whirring noise that the laptop was making so that they could try and assess the problem. I was unable to email back with the recording the following day but I did reply the next day. In response to this email, I received an email back stating that my case had been closed.   I contacted HP and had to start the process all over again. This time I tried to resolve the problem over their live chat option, but the technician told me that they couldn’t do anything for me without me having the laptop in front of me. So the next day, I reluctantly took my laptop into work on a busy train and into a busy town. On my lunch break I contacted HP again and they remote accessed my laptop and began work on it. As I was using poor WiFi in a coffee shop and had limited time on my break, it was not sufficient time for the work to be completed and the work that was done (updating drivers and deleting temporary folders) still did not resolve the issues. On my way home from work, my bag was knocked off my shoulder at the train station and hit the floor. When I got home, I found that my laptop - that was in a protective case, was badly damaged.  I can appreciate that this was accidental damage and not covered under the product’s warranty but due to the ineffective helpline and inconvenient operating hours they have, I had no choice but to take my laptop into an environment where it was at risk of getting damaged.  When contacting HP again the technician told me I couldn’t talk to a complaints team as my complaint was not valid. The whole customer service experience was appalling and made it very difficult to get issues resolved on a product and ultimately contributed to the subsequent damaged caused. I was told it would cost at least £300 to fix - the laptop cost £480.   I told the technician, in the original call to them, that the laptop clearly had a hardware issue, as the noise it was making was very loud. I later found out that the technician’s original call notes said that he believed, from what I had told him, that it was a hardware issue. So surely the laptop should have been arranged to be collected and repaired on the first day I made contact? They however, seemed to do everything they could to avoid this.   In summary: the HP product I bought had multiple issues very soon after buying it, their helpline is ineffective and no use if you work Monday to Friday, and you can’t make a complaint unless THEY decide it’s valid.

Online the virtual assistant is like picking out pre-written (irrelevant) notes from a hat and thoroughly useless.

"dict","On 16 / 06 / 2018, I bought an HP laptop for £289 from Currys/PC World Basingstoke. I found out later it was a Desktop TGCJ4TA which was not on the laptop.  Before I purchased the HP laptop, I asked the salesman if the laptop would be quick as I would be using Microsoft Office, sending and receiving emails with attachments and watching movies, he said it would be perfect for these actions.  In the first few weeks, apart from loading both McAfee and Microsoft Office I didn’t use the laptop because I was waiting for a friend to retrieve the files from a previous HP laptop, which had crashed and wouldn’t even start up. When I first used it was when I noticed how very slow it was. When I first took it back to Currys PC World to complain, which I found out was 4 or 5 days after Currys PC World’s guarantee ran out. I told them how very very slow it was, and the technician, who was very helpful, agreed that it was slow but suggested it was probably because I had not downloaded all the HP updates. I took it home and downloaded all the updates, which were many, however it was still very, very slow and frustrating to use. I took it back again on the 29th July and this time the same technician agreed that it was still very slow; he spent a couple of hours in the store to try to find out why, and after he had tried everything including reloading the Windows10 operating system, he said he would have to send it away where they had more equipment to be able to find out why it was so slow.   On, the 1st of August at around 10.20 am, I received a call from a technician from their ‘Team Knowhow' and he told me that he had reloaded Windows 10 and it was still very slow but then added ‘HP should not be still selling this Laptop and there was nothing more he could do’. I am sure that they record all their calls so must be able to go back and listen to his exact words. On their repair document it states that their repair experts are fully accredited by many of the top tech brands; if this is the case then his statement telling me that HP shouldn’t be selling this laptop which in turn means that Currys PC World also shouldn’t be selling it. My old HP laptop was quicker than this one and it was about 10 years old and the only reason I chose another one was because the old one had been fine with no problems. Later in the week I got a call from their Basingstoke store and was told the laptop was back and to come and pick it up. When I got there and tried it out it was still slow and the same technician who had worked on it before, agreed that it was still very slow tried a few things to see if he could find out why but couldn’t resolve the problem and when he asked his manager if I could have a refund or a replacement he refused on the grounds that it was out of your ‘3 week’ guarantee but didn’t even mention the HP guarantee. He then asked a different manager and received the same answer, although HP guarantee their products for 1 year.  The laptop is not fit for purpose and for some activities I am not exaggerating, it is like watching paint dry, it also freezes and I can’t do anything except restart the laptop. When I was on the phone to the 'Team Knowhow' technician I asked him what kind of laptop I should have to make sure it didn't run slowly. He told me I needed a 128GB SSD card with an i3, i5 or i7 processor minimum and an 8 GB of memory. When I went on line to find out what was in the HP laptop I had bought, it was no longer on their website. I did however see another laptop on their website that had a 128GB SSD card with an i3 processor which was only £33 more than I had paid for my HP laptop and so the salesman, when asked if the HP I was buying would be quick enough for what I was going to use it for  should have told me that to be sure of not having a slow laptop I needed a 128GB SSD card with an i3, i5 or i7 processor and 8 GB of memory, as the 'Team Knowhow' technician had recommended. Whether the salesman did not have the knowledge necessary to advise me on whether it was slow or not, or was just trying to get rid of old junk because he was instructed to do so by his manager makes no difference, Currys/PC World and in turn HP are responsible for selling me something that is not fit for purpose and sold it under false pretences. Why would the in store technician spend 2 hours trying to find out why the lap top was slow if it wasn’t, he would have said that the laptop I had bought was always very slow, and why would the ‘Team Knowhow’ technician tell me that HP shouldn’t be selling that laptop, which in turn means that Currys/PC World shouldn’t be selling it and according to the claim on your website which I have copied below, it states that your laptops have been hand-picked by your experts and that your ‘experts’ can help to pick the right one, so why didn’t they?  I have videoed me trying to open a file and I watched it for 2 minutes and then gave up and had to shut down the laptop to stop the small circle continue to try opening the file. I have also only just discovered that when I send photos of the document related to this issue by email from my phone, I managed after a while to print one of the documents after quite a time but on the next 2 documents the laptop froze when trying to bring up the image to print, so I have had to send the emails to my daughter’s laptop for her to print them. I have finally managed to open two of the files in ‘Paint which I will attach. Under the Consumer Rights Act consumers have the right to a refund or replacement if the product is faulty or not as described and I believe that both of these apply in this case. Currys PC World have washed their hands of this and as they didn’t offer to refund me under HP’s guarantee then I assume HP have washed their hands on this.  I will never consider another HP product again, or shop at Currys PC World.","review","english","HP","Neil Jackson","4","2018-08-21T10:03:05.000+00:00","HP laptop is not fit for purpose","1"
"dict","HP Tech Support Sucks! I recently purchased a HP Pavilion Laptop. I had always been a Dell customer to this point. It was a horrible experience! During set up, the first thing it did was ask me to set up a password. I used the same password I had used on my Dell. While downloading files to a zip drive (since Microsoft 10 doesn't allow the use of a data transfer cable), my computer powered down. When I powered it back up, it asked for my password. When I entered the password, it told me the password was incorrect. Repeated attempts gave the same result. The paperwork that came with the computer promised tech support. After repeated attempts to contact them both online and by phone, I finally reached them by phone. Imagine my surprise when the tech told me there would be a $49.99 charge because I had started the setup process, which now made it a software problem, not  hardware problem. Not only that, but they would then require $14.99 a month thereafter! Some years ago, I had had this problem with a new Dell computer during setup. When I contacted Dell, they explained this would be a free service this one time only, and then very competently set about helping me reset my password. Needless to say, had I had this response from HP, I would be a satisfied customer. However, a product is only as good as its tech support, and HP's tech support sucks!

He went on to explain all the features and how he was the manager there so he could give me a good price and to call him back and he could also discount the next ink purchase.  He told me that it fitted all paper sizes and it was an all in one printer. Well after I received it, I found out it did not have the features he stated it did and did not fit but normal paper sizes and then it keeps loosing internet and scanning functions. Then when you try and copy or scan from the top tray it takes multiple pages and you have to babysit it so it does not jam.  I called for help and I received links to sites which were only to sales features and not help sites and then also the manual and then was told that she added the optional tray to my cart for my convience so I could use the specialty papers. Not only were these sites not answers but they were not even for my printer and then I was not going to by another tray and when I looked at the tray it was only to hold more paper and it did not allow larger sizes either and it was also for a different printer.  Then she had the nerve to tell send me a link for another printer to purchase that would do the larger paper size after I told her that the tray was not for larger paper.  Then HP sent me a email to give them feedback and I did and then rejected it and told me my comments were not allowed and I could write something else.

Called Customer service, they pushed on me a 3 Year warranty and the McAffee virus program this cost me over $200.-. They told me after that we can fix the problem. After several days and hours with a technician I think the problem was fixed. Then I had a problem with my touchpad, still have the problem. Called HP, I thought I had a warranty, not so the $200.- 3 year warranty was only for software problems. Now I have a hardware problem. It is not covered under this warranty. My touchpad is very sensitive, tried to adjust it with software, no luck. often the pointer jumps around, then deleting in the middle of writing a letter or email half of it and had to rewrite again. Opens up automatically websites. The touchpad left and right click is horrible, have to touch only a small section of the right or left button so it get recognized. The turn on button is not good at all. It is a small rectangle bar. When you push this button you don't know, did it turn on the Laptop or not. Because it takes a while until the hp logo appears on the screen. No other sign of life. A round start button with a light coming on would be great. I would not recommend Hp to buy a computer.

"dict","Utterly awful company. Bought a top spec Spectre 13 x360 - to be fair, a great piece of hardware - and had one of the speakers fail. That’s OK, I thought, it’s a simple swap out and I had purchased the extended warranty. Laptop was in perfect condition when sent away, came back with a letter saying they had fixed some out of warranty damage without charge. What? There was no damage! But, they put it in a “new” case with a new keyboard. I say “new” because the replacement chassis had marks and scratches on it. The pain didn’t end there.  The rubber strips on the base weren’t stuck down properly. They had used the wrong size screw under one of the strips, so it pokes out and doesn’t sit flat on the table. Worse still, the base wasn’t even snapped in properly on one side, leaving a big gap and causing the base to bend.  Here’s the best (worst) bit: there are two black screws on the base, but they used a silver one and then coloured it in with a Sharpie pen!!! Not even just the screw, they coloured the chassis all around the screw?!?!  And don’t get me on to the dirty state of it and the fact they had tried to clean it with a wet cloth - there is water residue on the shiny hinges.  They also wiped the laptop when there was no need to do so.  I made a video if you want to see. Search for “spectre x360 botched repair” on YouTube; my channel is Constant Geekery.  Under U.K. consumer law I am entitled to withdraw from the contract after a failed repair and return the notebook for a full refund. But, I bought this through my company, so HP have told me consumer law doesn’t apply and it’s another repair or nothing. I’m sending it for repair and then I’ll sell it. I’m heading to the Apple Store now. I’ve bought close to 100 Apple products through work, and whilst some have needed repairs, Apple has always done a great job or provided new replacements without quibble.

Att vara en erfaren ingenjör kan jag förstå att ett företag som inte kan förutsäga livet för bärarens mekaniska gångjärn genom någon vetenskaplig verifieringsmetod år 2018 och inte har kapacitet att testa och validera livet för mekaniska gångjärn, tro mig att ett sådant företag inte har kompetens inom ingenjörskunskap och de får inte ha utvecklingsingenjörer som kan bli gravid eller förstå det. Jag kan garantera dig att det här företaget bara har endast 3D-modellerare som inte är tillräckligt kompetenta för att konceptualisera produkten vetenskapligt och bara utveckla konstnärliga mönster .... Slösa inte bort dina hårda intjänade pengar på sådant ovetenskapligt företag..ENGLISH..........Please always rely on actual users reviews rather than sponsored reviews available on different websites. I would recommend you all to stay away with HP with my own overall bad experience with HP. Being an experienced engineer, I can understand that a company which can not predict life of laptop's mechanical hinge through any scientific verification method in year 2018 and do not  have capacity to test and validate the life of mechanical hinges then believe me such company does not have competency of engineering know-how and they may not have development engineers who may conceive or even understand it. I can guarantee you that this company only has only 3D modellers who are not competent enough to conceptualize the product scientifically and develop artistic designs only....Do not waste your hard earned money on such unscientific company.","review","english","HP","Praveen Parmar","2","2018-07-30T10:41:29.000+00:00","HP Laptop","1"

As I was taking part in completing a course every month with an exam shortly afterwards, I couldn't find the time to continue with the unit.   I contacted HP support in January and since that time until now, there are about 8 support calls that I have had to place before I finally got through to someone. Overall it took about 6 months to get through.  I sent it in for repair, mind you, the unit was functioning after my initial set up, just slow, and this is what I told support from day 1. I send the unit in for repair and they're saying the motherboard is fried. I practically begged to have a ""run report"" done so they could see that I -in fact- had turned the unit on many times. They did not do this. Instead they said there was water damage. This unit was functioning in my care and it must have been damaged at the centre and/or in transit. It wasn't returned in the original box and my note that was included in the package was not sent.   -each call was about 45 minutes in length to 1 hour -on one occasion they spelled my name horribly wrong which resulted in no contact in any way shape or form -on one occasion I was told that they would request a replacement and this wasn't done  This is a very very disappointing HP experience, to a degree that I cannot communicate in words.

"dict","HP Spectre x360 has touch screen but I mostly use usb-mouse. Not sure if that triggered the issues which made the computer unusable: the opened programs shaked changing size without user intervention. Usb-mouse nor touch screen couldn´t control the computer. Only closing/reopening the lid stabilized the screen. During the one year warranty period I had to send HP Spectre to the service twice. The first service took four weeks and despite they claimed to have changed the display the issues was not repaired. Second service took another four weeks and it seemed that the lid+touch screen is now changed. The issue has also been away longer than one month now. During normal operation the battely life is six-seven hours. The really disturbing thing is that battery looses it´s capacity 7% per 24h in shutdown mode! The service didn´t react to this issue. I bought HP Spectre in April 2017. Since that HP Support Assistant has twice suggested BIOS update. Both updates went ok but next day after the latter update Windows 10 didn´t start up!

I have been using HP cartridges at £17 per cartridge but will now be using Tescos own make at £9 as HP do not deserve the business.","review","english","HP","Jmacnab","1","2018-04-26T12:46:37.000+00:00","Yellow ink runs out very quickly","1"

"dict","I am truly astounded by the service I have received from HP.  I called HP regarding my laptop which won't switch on after having the laptop for 1 year 3 months (3 months out of warranty). I was told I would have to pay £300 for a repair even though they don't know what the issue is and I have only owned it for a short period.   When I tried to ask if their laptops were only designed to last one year they just kept repeating the same sentence to me that as it was out of warranty and  I would have to pay £300 to get the laptop fixed. Very rudely when I said I could purchase a brand new one for that amount of money replied 'we could give you a good deal on a new one'.  I then requested to raise a complaint, but was advised I wasn't allowed as I didn't have a valid complaint. I was not allowed to raise a complaint.  When I escalated this and after much argument they provided me with a customer relations email which I was to respond to with my complaint. When I responded with my complaint it bounced back saying the complaint had been closed.  I then called the general number to follow up my email and they advised that the customer services team had called me and told me they had closed my complaint- which they hadn't. Upon investigation they admitted they hadn't called but had closed my complaint as it was 'invalid'.  I asked if the Customer Relations department could call me themselves but was advised they would try to get them to call me but they 'probably wouldn't' and also refused to put their response in writing.   I found it very rude that they didn't advise me via email/ phone or attempt to speak to me in any way before closing the complaint. I have had no response since and the outcome of the complaint was still pay £300 or the laptop will remain broken.   I am truly astounded and disgusted in the service provided by HP. I am a Buyer for a large company and therefore am aware of both the role of Consumer Relations team and their importance as well as the Sale of Goods Act/ Consumer Rights Act which states items must be fit for purpose and of an acceptable quality- my laptop being neither of these things.   I have never owned a laptop that has lasted just over one year and am truly astounded that HP were so rude and unwilling to look in to this for both myself and potential other customers which could be affected.   I will not be recommending HP to anyone else and looking at other reviews many people also feel the same.   In desperate need for improvements in customer service and internal processes.","review","english","HP","Sam Mason","2","2018-04-20T08:29:32.000+00:00","Truly astounded and disgusted by HP service","1"

"dict","I ordered a keyboard from HP online. When they attempted to deliver it to my home address, no one was home so they left me a card with details on the back stipulating that I could change the delivery address. So I did, to my work address.  I waited a few days for my delivery but nothing came, so I called HP. The lady on the phone stated that there was no record of me changing the address - no biggie, I asked her to change the address to my work and she said that I should expect the package within a few days. She apparently did it and we hung up the phone.  A few more days passed and I still had not received the package. I called HP again and she stated that there was no record of anyone changing the address, so she ""changed it"" again. We hung up the phone. I got an email the next day stating that they could not deliver it to my work address that I provided and if it was okay if they leave it at my door without a signature - I have no patience anymore so I just agree.  I then get a call from my work stating that toll just called and said they would leave my package at a COMPLETELY different address that I did not mention at all nor even know.  I called the complaint line and the man on the phone said that he is on it and will fix it.  I'm still waiting on my package - I'm unsure of whether Toll has already delivered it because they haven't even provided me with a tracking number.

"dict","Three years ago, I purchased a high-end HP envy laptop for $1600. One year post-purchase I had a hardware issue with the motherboard. The laptop was still under warranty, so I sent it to get repaired. 6 months later, I had another issue with the motherboard. It was still under warranty, so I asked my escalation manager at HP to ensure that the root cause of this issue was being addressed while the laptop was still under warranty. There should not have been the same issue with the hardware, under such a short amount of time if it had already been fixed. They assured me that they’d address the root cause of the problem, and I sent it back for repairs. A year later, for a third time, I’ve had another hardware issue, with my motherboard. My computer is no longer under warranty, though I believe the root cause of what has been ailing my computer has never been addressed, even while I was a paying customer of HP’s customer care plan. Today, I spent over 4 hours on the phone with HP, trying to explain the situation I’m having, and trying to find some sort of agreeable solution to move forward and have my computer fixed. After speaking with several people in multiple departments, I finally was connected with Joyti, the supervisor in Repairs. I was told there was nothing they could do for my laptop as it was out of warranty. They said they could offer zero discount on trying to find some kind of solution and said the base cost of assessing and fixing my computer would be ~$500.   In total, I’ve spent over 24 hours on the phone with HP, to resolve all of these issues to try to find a way to stop this reoccurring issue. I have paid over $2000 on a laptop, including extended warranty, and this “high-end” product has lasted less than 3 full years. I put in tons of time and money and am now left with no laptop, an awful customer experience, and I feel completely disrespected in the way that they have treated me.   To anyone interested in purchasing an HP product, please don’t just look at the technical reviews of the product.

It got great reviews (from biased professional companies).  It turns out, HP knows it has flaws; MAJOR FLAWS!  I kept thinking it was my set up choices and assuming it was MS 10 Pro.....IT WASN'T!  IT WAS HP HARDWARE!  After MANY calls to support, it turns out they all have bad TPM's and software integration into the hardware. They even had the gall to tell me they would not be supporting HP Security Client in the future.  That's the whole point of the notebook (the first of many lies!). Anyways, pass the buck, pass the buck, pass the buck, send me to a non english speaking person who just says ""you notebook ok, right"", ""you notebook ok, right"". NO IT ISN'T ALL RIGHT.  I send it to be repaired and it comes back scratched and scuffed with the little kid version of 10 installed and not set up.  After many calls and EMAILS TO THE CEO, STILL NO RESPONSE OR RECONCILIATION.  CEO SHOULD RESIGN.  So any ways, contact your local news agencies and get them to help you out.

"dict","Lousy customer service after they took over samsung printers. I had a toner fault within 6 months and although on their system that my warranty is valid as I had register the warranty then. But I am unable to get a toner replacement because I lost my original receipt. And they told me even if my printer is under warranty for 3 years, if any repair was required, I am also not covered because I lost my original invoice. Customer officers took so long to review just a toner issue. It has been more than 2 months since this matter was brought up to the customer service and it cannot be settled.

They are just people who answer the phone and have no idea about anything, and apparently are unsupervised.   For example I had a very basic question and they could not comprehend it.  I wanted to know how to type the  symbols which are printed in blue, which are on keyboard buttons.  These are  normally accessed via the function key.    The girl would not listen. She just talked over me.  She said ""so  you want to type in blue""?  I said no and repeated my question, but she interrupted, and talked over me, you cannot type in blue from the keyboard, am I speaking a foreign language or something?.  Then I called back and got another guy.and that call just dropped after he asked for the serial number.  The third time I called.  I got a guy named Russel, after 20 minutes we determined the function key was in fact working, and the blue symbols should be typing  but when he put me on hold to stand in line at the real support desk again, I just got disconnected again it seems because the music on hold just shut off and at 25 minutes I just hung up.

"dict","HP’s service is absolutely appalling, I bought a laptop for my company and paid £800 for it. Shortly after receiving my laptop, my work required me to connect the laptop to an external monitor. It was at this point I learnt that the HDMI port was not working, I raised the issue with HP they attempted to fix the problem by connecting to the device remotely but were unable to fix the issue. HP made me aware that because the laptop was out of its 30-day warranty, the only option left was to send the laptop in for repair. I explained to HP that I am self-employed and that I need a laptop to make a living and sending it off for repair meant I would not be able to work, resulting in me not getting paid. HP advised that they cannot provide a replacement or compensation, as I was in urgent need for this issue to be fixed I agreed for the laptop to be sent off for repair. I missed two days of work whilst the laptop was with HP and suffered a £700 loss of earnings, I soon received the laptop back and to my surprise the HDMI port was still not working. I contacted HP again to report the issue, they apologised for the inconvenience and requested I send the laptop in for repair again. At this point I was fuming, I was thinking “are you crazy?” I just lost £700 due to a manufacture fault but you are asking me to send in the laptop again. I could not believe HP were asking me to send in my laptop again and loose earnings due to an error on their behalf, they would not agree to compensate, they would not agree to send a replacement all HP were saying is “were sorry for your inconvenience”.  Absolutely appalling, I would understand if I was responsible for the HDMI port not working but I didn’t break it HP sold me the laptop with a faulty HDMI port. I think it is dreadful, at times like this I wish I was a celebrity, so I could publicly make know how ridiculous and useless HP are. I'm currently seeking legal advice as I refuse to lose more days of earnings due to HP's fault, oh yea not to mention that their customer service is diabolical. No empathy shown, there agents handle my case without a care in the world. PLEASE AVOID BUYING ANYTHING FROM HP!!!

On arrival it would not boot so I installed the software from the recovery partition. 2 months later it would not work with my son's monitor, which I had to switch with mine.

The service agreement states they will collect it the next working day and return it within 7 working days of the original phone call. However, now they state that they will collect it two working days after the call and will try to return it within 10 days of the ""date of collection"". So I could be without this machine for almost three weeks. They still have a chance to redeem themselves and I will report back on the level of service actually received.

And as much as I moaned online I think it’s fair to say they corrected everything and I’m once again a happy HP customer. I would definitely say that HP need to do some more work on there in house reporting system, even a few phone numbers for unhappy customers might be nice to escalate there problems! But credit where it’s due so thank you HP Jg     Where to start, AVOID HP AT ALL COSTS!  I bought direct from HP a £1500 computer that was bought and delivered seemlesly. The problems started when the machine was broken on set up and wouldn’t work. I spent 4 hours logging and talking to an engineer at hp who agreed I needed a replacement computer, another 4 hours later of being put on hold or just left waiting for the phone to be answered I got through to a human being!! The only option they offered was to collect the machine and then they would authorise a new machine which kinda sucks because they should have just swapped it on the day, but no. My machine was collected and here I am still waiting for a new machine. I’ve emailed them constantly and am ignored as to the out come I’ve requested my money back and still no answer or money!! ISNT THIS JUST STEALING, OBTAINING MONEY BY DECEPTION?? I’ve even written to Dion Weisler President &amp; CEO, HP Inc at the executive level so fingers crossed I might even get my money back!!

"dict","One day this past month, I found my Pavilion turned off. When I restarted it, it just made 3 loud and long beeps, followed by 3 more beeps of a different tone; the screen never turned on. HP support said I had to send it back for repairs, so I did reluctantly. A few days after HP said it arrived I received a broken, grainy, and non-understandable voice message to call back. I tried, but always got the voice mail of my case worker. The next messages to me were to say HP sent my computer back to me; these messages were not understandable either. When my computer arrived this pay week, I was totaled shocked and understandably upset. My screen was completely smashed and destroyed, with pieces of glass missing. When I finally found someone to connect me directly to my case worker, he told me my computer arrived like that and repairing it wasn't covered under my warranty. When I told him it was pristine when I shipped it to them, using their packing materials and that he needed to file a claim with fedex for damages during shipping,  he refused, repeatedly. In fact, when I was allowed to speak to his supervisor, he told me to file my own claim with fedex because he wouldn't either and ""good luck"" with that. I cannot believe HP support is that horrible, and their protocols are to never file a claim when an item arrives damaged in shipping. The reason he came up with was he ""can't"" submit a claim to fedex because the box wasn't damaged, and HP's protocols says they ""can't."" Can't really meant won't, as he kept refusing to help resolve the damage to my computer. I sent HP my $1400 computer in good faith, and they sent me back a piece of trash with no apology for destroying it.  In fact, HP support hasn't proven to me they didn't damage it themselves.  Since Customer support refused to help me, I called fedex myself, and they were ten-thousand times more helpful. They immediately started s claim for me. Now HP support is refusing to provide a shipper waiver, so I can be reimbursed for the damage to my computer. What kind of operation and hateful people work at HP?  I don't understand why they are refusing to help me. At this point, if I ever get reimbursed (which will not be due to any help from HP support), I will NEVER buy another HP product again.","review","english","HP","J Mann","1","2018-01-22T07:41:20.000+00:00","HP Support Destroyed my Pavilion and won't fix it now","1"

"dict","There is little wonder that the company has such a shockingly poor rating on this site. I would give them 0 stars if I could. Truly horrible experience and I would encourage you to stay well away from this company and its products. On 26/11/16 I bought my HP laptop for around £600. In December 2016 HP contacted me to say I’d been sent the wrong model, and on 11/01/17 they replaced it and gave me my correct, current laptop. This was the first mistake they made and it inconvenienced me greatly, but at least it was eventually resolved. Then on 4/5 November 2017 weekend I travelled with my laptop and charger stored securely in a laptop bag, but later noticed that it had sustained several scratches despite being stored responsibly. This obviously indicates poor quality paintwork on the laptop as its own charger was so easily able to scratch it. On 7th November I spoke to HP customer services and told them this story in detail, and they reassured me that my laptop’s chassis would be replaced free of charge under my warranty. I was actually impressed at how easy and professional this had been. I was very wrong! Laptop was taken away, and on 22/11/17 I got a receipt that it had been received in the repair centre. To my surprise, a few days later I was contacted by someone from HP called Nuno L., who claims to be someone senior in the customer relations department but refuses to provide his manager's details. This person demanded payment for the job despite acknowledging that HP had told me this would be free. I tried to question the ethics of this with him but he was rude and would not listen. He would not shift on the demand for payment, or honour the promise his previous colleague had made. Instead of addressing my point, he had the laptop sent back to me without being repaired, having wasted a lot of my time and compromised my productivity whilst I had been without my laptop. I should not be in any way responsible or have to bear the consequences for their customer services team not knowing what is and isn’t covered by the warranty and at what cost- once a promise has been made, it should be honoured, and this is what I have repeatedly tried to contact HP about. A £57 repair to a chassis means nothing to such a large company but means everything to a customer who has been treated so poorly, with continuous mistakes from them. I’ve tried to complain several times to people on online chat but no one is bothered or interested in helping. In fact, these people claim that a complaints department doesn't exist, and have offered me a 'discounted' repair at three times the price that Nuno L. was demanding! Disgusting crooks, out to squeeze money from innocent people who have already spent large amounts on their products.","review","english","HP","Rose A","1","2017-12-29T06:11:22.000+00:00","Disgusting customer 'service', 0 stars!","1"
"dict","My computer needed the OS to be rebooted on the Pavilion x360 laptop. This laptop, at the time of repair, was only 6 months old. After 2 hrs of troubleshooting the computer, they sent me 3 emails of recovery files to create the recovery drive. I tried this several times over the course of a month and nothing worked.  It took a month of arguing to get A CONVERSATION with a manager since the technicians refused to allow this before.   After another hour long conversation with the manager, they agreed to finally let me ship in my computer for repair (WHICH I ASKED FOR OVER A MONTH).  All of this could have been avoided with a local repair, however, HP does not have ample repair centers to help their customers.  After this repair and the life of this HP computer, I will never be going back to HP products and will happily be shopping elsewhere.","review","english","HP","Roger Schoch","1","2017-12-27T05:33:11.000+00:00","Poor Product Support, Not Buying an HP Product Again","1"

"dict","I am unsure how to rate it below 1 star, but if I did they would get nothing. My computer had an update, so of course I did it. Well that update crashed my computer. When I called hp I was told that I need to ask them if my computer is compatible with the update which is ridiculous. After arguing for about an hour and a half, I paid the $59.99 for the one time support.   When I finally got in touch with the technician after another hour and a half on hold my issue was not resolved, and I was told that my hard drive needs to be replaced. The tech then told me I would get a call from billing the following day to work on my refund.   Well the next day came and not one call. I call later in the evening I get told billing will call me the following day, guaranteed. Following day no call, and to top it off I get an email from the bank saying my account has been overdrafted. I look up my transactions, and I was charged twice for the one time support which I was not supposed to be charged for anyway.   I call yet again and I am told for the third time my case has been escalated to a higher up position and they will be calling me the next day to help. Of course no call. Now I’m down $127 and nobody will take the time to call.   I call back since that is the only way I am able to get in touch with someone, and they tell me yet again that my case has been escalated and I will get a call that night. Yet again not a single phone call. Today is now Day 5 that I am down $127, and have spoken to not one person who is able to help me. I was transferred four times and got nowhere. I was told I am unable to be transferred to anyone higher up than a floor supervisor. Now I am guaranteed a call back by a case manager, and I will receive a follow up call the following day to see if I did in fact get a call.

Soon after the order I realised the HP care pack wasn't a good fit for me. The salesman on the phone made It seem like the right product for me, but soon afterwards I realised it wasn't what I wanted. The limited information on the HP site about the care packs didn't help. So I decided to return the carepack and I wanted my money back. As quick a help you get when you want to buy a product, the more you get ignored if you want to return a product. First of all, the return form on the HP website if completely unusable. So, I created my own form with all the information needed to return a product. I e-mailed, called, facebooked and what not, no reaction at all! At this point I'm considering legal steps to get my money back. Note: I didn't activatie the care pack. Another thing: the delivery of the physical products was really, really bad. I didn't even have to sign for the package (for a 1000+ euro laptop!!!!), and hey didn't send me any correct information about my order and when It was surposed to arrive.

This is not good from an online ""global"" company that makes such a big thing of providing their web-based ""Solutions"".  ""Write to our Customer Care Manager if you're not happy"", so they said. I did to enquire where said cartridge might be purchased and a brief email came back pointing me to exactly the same HP ordering page that I'd outlined as being devoid of any useful information.   I do not think it unreasonable to expect a company the size of HP to offer a truly global support service and, secondly, if you are going to big-up your customer care, at least show a modicum of interest through reading your customers' emails properly.

I could not be more disappointed with a printer. The 2 main things that I think are ridiculous about this printer is firstly how difficult it is to connect to a computer, the wireless is a nightmare, it has its own connection but then you have to disconnect from your own wifi so then you can't print straight from the internet it makes no sense. I also have a MacBook Pro which has no USB port so cannot be connected that way so wifi is the only option. The other major thing is the amount of your ink it wastes on pointless pages of print out instructions its the stupidest idea I have ever come across with a printer. Why hp didn't just write up a decent instructions manual for this printer I will never know, instead they waste all your expensive ink on instruction sheet after instruction sheet! Then that sheet telling you that you need to press another button to print out another instructions sheet and so on until you waste a whole cartridge of ink before you even get going!

I called customer support, they told me that its not frozen and it is a process that will take 2-3 hours. I waited, nothing happened. Called back 3.5 hours later and another lady told me that I have to click SKIP, and that it was never frozen, and now I have to wait 3-5 Hours!!!!!  Ridiculous. I asked to speak to a Supervisor, and she hung up on me!  Called back again, asked to speak to a supervisor again, I've currently been on hold for 16 minutes. We'll see how long it takes them this time. I'm not sure how they are allowed to be in business, or be on the market at all. They are a SCAM!! STAY AWAY!

When i told them i dont have one anymore that i had to bring it to a shop to get the virus off. They told me they couldnt help with a refund.OR the only way was to go to an Hp store i told her there was non available where i lived. I tried to help her by giving her a CA number of a confirmation email. She told me no that wont help.They want you to keep purchasing things which wont resolve the issue.  You constantly hear them in the background laughing at you. I asked to speak to a manager and the woman (Veronica or something) who was from India because that is were customer service is located told me she was in Long island New York. (Lol) she then told me she was the manager there which i told her that was impossible. Then she told me the mamager didnt want to speak to me because i was a b**** and hung up the phone on me.   I called back to speak to a man who also didnt want to help me and didnt believe that their customer service was horrible. He then told me to get my credit card out. Which i thought he was going to refund me and told me to look for the 1800 # in the back of the card and told me them call them to get the refund. I told him that not how a ctrdit worked that HP had to refund...he then told me sorry have a nice day and hung up on me.   I ended up furiated and called sales which was in canada supposedly who listenned to me but was unable to help only to tell me customer support was always in India and she couldnt refund me. She took my information down and told me to stay on line and called customer support and put with someone. Then that man was supposedly able to look into the problem who only Cold transfered me to another man who i had to re explain everything to. Told me the refund is 24 to 72 hours business days someone will contact us. Yeah right!  Later on we got unknown phone call at 850 pm and my mother was on the phone with them (precious ppl who couldnt help) and they were saying they cant help us and that they have a f*** issue with me and wanted to speak to me.

I would like  to inform you that I am no longer going to be loyal to your services anymore or purchase any HP products in the future. Even I have advised my family members against purchasing any products from HP.  I am aware that I am an out of warranty customer, but the treatment or the level of service that I got from your customer service &amp; Technical support agents today at 14:00 PM IST on September 15th 2017, was absolutely disgusting. There was a floor supervisor named Anirban S and he is not fit to be a supervisor, he disconnected my call after he realised, he failed in providing me the service or help, which was necessary.   I understand that it is necessary for us to purchase warranties, but if your technical support team is incompetent to resolve my issue, then what is the point? This was my issue and it was simple. I was looking over your drivers to ensure my laptop had the best and updated version, I stumbled across Bios update F.27 Rev.A released on September 12th 2016, after installing this and after restarting my notebook, it went to a blank screen, If you read the notes, you will find that it's compatible with Windows 7 64bit Home Basic, which is what I have. Your team has failed me miserably and I have called your pathetic, incompetetant call center more than 27 times today.   I am going to update this to my friends and families, not to purchase any of HP products. I was planning to get HP desktops/laptops and printers in the future for business purposes, but thanks to the pathetic service that I got, I changed my mind and i am moving forward with someone who offers a better customer service and product.  If you go to google and type "" HP call center in India sucks "" you would get a comment by your own staff, who has stated his true intentions of being employed with HP. I was made mockery by  your call center, they put me on mute and had a laugh and was abusing me in Hindi. Though I am a South Indian, I was barely able to grasp thier words, when they communicated with me in English, such was their knowledge of English, I think your staff never attended school to be honest. I don't wish to tell you more, but if you go through the comments left by others also, you will understand the level of their frustration and the poor services of HP, which will make you lose loyal customers.

I then contacted HP via facebook just to be told they cannot help me as my computer is a ""business"" machine and gave me a link to their rubbish site with no contact information. I wasn't happy with this so I messaged back to explain that I cannot raise a query on their website as they don't believe my laptop exists.

"dict","My roommate recently bought an HP OfficeJet 6962 printer, and had only used it a few times during the summer and once or twice during this current school semester. Recently the printer had run out of ink, and the cartridges were replaced, only the black cartridge did not work and nothing black was printing. So after several attempts, I finally gave in and called Tech Support. I was routed to a man who sounded Indian with rudimentary understanding of English, and it was difficult to communicate with him (I guess outsourcing is cheaper, but it makes for a much less enjoyable customer experience). He then proceeds to tell me that he would connect me to a technician who would sort the problem out, but that there would be a 130 dollar fee if he could successfully identify and fix the issue. So he accessed my computer remotely and tried very basic steps to fix the issue, and after repeated failures for over 2 HOURS, he finally declared that there was a hardware issue and that I would need another printer. So as upset as I already was, it was made even worse by the fact that I was charged 100 DOLLARS because the technician worked ""very hard"" to resolve the issue.

Computer has been shipped back to Hp the 3rd time for repair in 2 months for the same problem.Have not been able to use this computer at all. Have been told by HP Customer Service in Dallas, Texas that this is a rare and unfortunate case and that I have no choice but to wait for the 3rd repair to be completed  requiring at least 7-10 more days.HP has refused to replace the defective computer. Their warranty is designed to protect HP not the consumer( just keep shipping back for repairs) warranty will eventually expire without hp correcting the issue.).

"dict","I recently needed to purchase a laptop for college. I have a low budget so I can't exactly afford an apple laptop. I purchased an HP PAVILION laptop for around 600$ at Costco. 1tb HDD, i5 processor, HD graphics, and also touchscreen... Sounds like a decent laptop right? NOPE. After 2 days the laptop had problems everywhere, and I mean, very laggy, many many glitches. I ended up returning it and getting a replacement (same exact laptop)... low and behold, 1 week later... same problems but this time I couldn't even charge the laptop while using it... It only charged when lid was closed or when off. At this point I really wished I used my 600$ at best buy because of the larger selection. I have nothing against Costco but I could only get a cash card when returning the product. So I decided to give customer service a call. The wait wasn't too bad... roughly 15-20 minute. When an operator finally answered... I COULD BARELY UNDERSTAND THIS DUDE! It was like he was speaking a different language. Sounded Indian to me. I was on the phone with the operator for 1 and a half hours and he fixed NOTHING. I even gave him remote access to my computer... he insisted I send the laptop in for repair and estimated it would be about a week or more. I START SCHOOL IN A COUPLE DAYS!!! This is just ridiculous. So I decided to do some investigating... I took this sucker apart to look at the parts they provided for my 600$. At this point I didn't care if I broke anything, I had nothing to lose. I'd just return it and get a new one. Since they break so freaking fast. Come to find out... they provide the cheapest parts possible! The 1tb hdd was WD Blue version. The price of one off the internet is not even 50$... And if they're getting these items bulk... imagine how cheap it is for them. And imagine the profit margins for them. Every other part in the computer, same story. Sure this laptop is a basic model but dang... I'm 100% Lenovo would offer a better 400$ laptop. Being a very adaptive person... I decided to take things into my own hands since I REALLY needed a computer for school. I took the WD Blue HDD, smashed it and got a new high quality SSD. At least this will last me long enough for me to buy a mac. This is very very corrupt... guess who picks up the tab when customers return these products...??? NOT HP. It's best buy, Costco, Walmart. It doesn't take a genius to realize but HP has realized it's at a point of no return. Now they are ripping off customers and squeezing money out of us. I REALLY hope justice is served somehow.","review","english","HP","Petr Bludov","1","2017-08-17T03:11:23.000+00:00","HP aka robbers","1"

I was convinced to switch to HP by the Spectre X360 and from the very first minute that I switched it on everything went wrong.  The laptop that I got had heating issues immediately and would almost burn me when touching it.  They sent it from Australia to Singapore to get fixed.  I had to wipe the whole computer before sending it so that took a day to do.  Then after two weeks it arrived back and it was still overheating.  Since then I have spent 6 months trying to sort this mess out.  I have been moved around different people and I have not been able to resolve it.

"dict","I bought an HP X476dw MFP all-in-one printer in 3/2016 through Office Depot. 15 mths later, a 1/4"" wide black streak was running down the full page of every document I tried to print. I also bought the 2 year warranty. The warranty company told me that the ""drum"" was a ""consumable good"" and not covered under the warranty. Told me to call HP directly. Over the next 2 days, I emailed and spoke to representatives in sale, parts, shopping and finally a supervisor. I even had to take pictures (5 total) of the ""drum"" and email them twice to different departments because people could not keep track of the calls and emails identifying the part and I was very tired of describing it. Parts told me that the machine was a discontinued machine and I could not get that part for it--period. They simply don't make them as it was discontinued. I was angry and demanded I speak to a supervisor. I got one. He claimed he couldn't read all the emails from me to the parts, sales and shopping dept and wanted me to go through the whole litany of the prior 2 days again. As I was explaining the situation, he kept saying, ""Hmmmm"" over and over again as well as ""interesting."" This ticked me off and felt placating and I expressed this sentiment. He kept trying to tell me he would check with parts and see if they could ""back order"" the part. I told him repeatedly I had emails from parts saying could not be done. He kept on saying the same thing over and over. I finally simply said go ahead and get back to me. I gave him my cell phone number. I said I wanted HP to give me 50% credit on a new machine. The phone call got ""dropped"" somehow. I waited 5 minutes for him to call me back. He never did. I called again and asked to speak to that same supervisor (didn't have his name) and was initially told she couldn't identify who I had spoken to. I refused to accept that answer and she finally asked me to hold. I did. She came back on the line and said he was on the phone and asked if she could help me. I asked what discount they'd give me. She finally said 10%. I told her no and that I would never buy another HP product.

My laptop, bought in late January is still under warranty and in early July the bottom casing of my laptop is coming away from the top part that holds the keyboard and track pad. No accidents happened and I am also not handling the laptop in any way that can cause damage. When I called the first time all was set to get it shipped for warranty repair, all I had to do was to verify how to handle the confidential information with my employer. When I called back to arrange for the pick up I was told that this repair is not under warranty and I would have to pay for it. All the sudden there were no notes of my first call, so no reference that I was told it is under warranty and I was told that this is my doing, even subconsciously and therefore the warranty does not apply. I find this very poor and very cheap performance of HP's part and I will never buy an HP again.

"dict","It is not just the service. It's the product warranty they claim to honor which they haven't. Every representative I have spoken to has told me different things in regards to repair for my laptop I sent in.   They say because the screen is cracked they cannot repair the internal damage that was due to the malfunctioning fan. They wouldn't even tell me what the exact damage was.   One representative I spoke to said that the laptop not turning on was because of the cracked screen. This was a complete LIE considering the cracked screen happened after my laptop randomly died on me.   Another said even if the issues were unrelated they still couldn't fix the damage under warranty because of the cracked screen. Does this make sense? I wasn't asking them to repair the screen, but to fix the damage I had nothing to do with.   I am inclined to believe that because my laptop is under warranty for only one more month they think they can screw me around until it expires.   He also told me he'd cut the price in half for the repairs. Does that make sense? if they were really believed to be my fault in the first place.   A representative I chatted with online said someone had already made a complaint about my product (not me) that the laptop damage was NOT customer induced.   It sounds like they are messing me around and trying to get out of a warranty they are supposed to honor.

I tossed the printer off the balcony and purchased a Epson for $45.

Not only is Wifi &amp; internet slow so is the computer's performance all around, takes forever to load even when using apps or programs you will have to wait....and wait. Video &amp; Photo quality is horrible, its pixely, faded, sometimes blurred, changing settings won't make any difference. Watching a movie was like watching a VHS cassette on an old static TV. The DVD drive is broken, it sometime take 3 tries to read a disk, claims there is no disc and make sounds like a jet engine and occasionally sound like it’s a paper shredder. This computer severely underperforms and has cheap, poor design, not worth the money you pay for it. The Wifi Card is bad, defective &amp; slow. You cannot watch YouTube, Google, other media videos higher than 240p or 360p without buffering every 20 seconds or so, you may as well forget watching 720 or 1080p, can't watch Neflix, Amazon or other movies at all...unless you want to watch a minute at a time between buffering. They lie and tell you this computer has ""crisp"" &amp; clear ""HD"" quality, this is a total joke. Last but not least this is personal preference but the to pad/left/right click buttons are stiff, unresponsive, have to press or swipe hard, turned up touch pad sensitivity settings and still felt like I had to pound not tap for it to work. Buttons are cheap, stiff and have to type harder than any other computer I've ever owned. I also personally hate the sandpaper like texture on the touchpad &amp; right side of keyboard...it feel horrible after more than a hour especially if you have to scroll often. Trying to set up printer, internet or personalize apps or desktop....is so not user friendly. Overall this is the worst computer I've ever owned out of Gateway, Lenovo, IBM and Dell.

I called a toll free number to get help - all I was doing was printing my wedding invitations which are 5.5"" X 7"", which is not an option on the printer and it refused to print... As I was calling the toll free number I got a call, since they weren't answering I picked up the incoming call and the guy on the line says ""Hi I had a missed call from this number.. What do you need?"" And I asked if he worked with HP (since I get and make calls from the same phone for work), to which he replied ""I got a missed call from this number""... Really sketched me out first of all.. Then he finally admitted he worked in the printer support department, when I told him my issue he said he didn't understand, so I re-explained and he said ""then you can't print it.  If that size is not an option then you can't print""... He was a very RUDE customer service person.  THEN, right after I was done with that call, I got another call from that number and the guy said the same thing about a missed call... After that I wrote to someone on IM from customer support... That person couldn't give me answers, but wanted to go into my computer to see what this issue was, AND CHARGE ME FOR IT.  WHAT A JOKE.  Literally bought this printer 3 hours ago and am already disappointed with my purchase....  All I wanted was a straight answer, did I waste my money on this printer since I now can't print what I need? OR is there a way to add a custom size paper?

"dict","I will never buy an HP product again. I bought a HP5740 printer from Staples. It was delivered with a damaged plug. I joined HP Instant Ink which I seriously do not recommend. This is supposed to save you money by monitoring the number of pages printed and sending new ink cartridges automatically when required. The trouble is, they find it impossible to provide an accurate page use figure. It is always too high (surprise!). Now, the printer tells me there is a fault with the tricolour cartridge. This prevents me printing anything. Sometimes it works but mostly it does not. Try contacting HP Support you say. Well, if you've got hours to spend trying to find anyone to speak to (actually you can't) and going round in circles that's fine. HP's Support function is the worst I have ever had to try to deal with. In desperation, I sent a webmail to the CEO, as follows: ""Remove and reinstall the indicated ink cartridge, making sure it is  correctly installed, and then touch OK"" This is the most troublesome printer I've ever had the misfortune to  own. At this moment, I feel the same as so many others who've posted  this problem with HP - the trouble shooting does not work &amp; I will never buy HP again. You need to pull out all the stops to retain me as a  customer. You supplied my cartridges Instant Ink XXXXXXXXX  Please send me a replacement tri-colour cartridge immediately. What a waste of time (Support is)! All it gets me is a link to live chat, Twitter etc. HPs support function is utterly appalling. It takes you round in circles with no resolution. I have no intention of wasting my valuable  time on such an unhelpful system. Please sort out my problem urgently. I need to use my printer.  Your Instant Ink product is no better. You supplied me with the  cartridge which does not work and I expect you to send me a new  cartridge, at no cost, upon receipt of this message. I hope to hear from you but I do not hold out much hope.""  The response I got, obviously automated: ""Thank you for writing to HP Inc. with your feedback. We value your opinion, and we are grateful that you took the time to share your thoughts with HP Inc. We apologize for the difficulties you might have experienced. We will be documenting your comments which will be reviewed by HP Inc. management.""  I sent that webmail 10 days ago and have had no other contact from anyone at HP, so obviously the CEO doesn't care about his customers, either existing or potential.

"dict","HP is the worst company. I own an HP Officejet 6600 All-in-One Printer. Since I received it as a gift approximately 3 years ago, it has been nothing but a lemon. When you want to print...don't be in a hurry. The printer has to cycle through a 15 minute process to check the device...everytime you want to print. There is no logging on, print and go. Unless you want to grow old waiting for your document...buy from someone else. When and if the printer finally begins to print the document, it prints one line...stops...prints the next line...stops. Again, you grow old trying to print a document. In my case, I will probably die before I ever get a document printed. Stage 4 cancer waits for no printer. Forget about Customer Support. First, you have to give them your name, rank, serial number, first born, blood type...must I go on??? Then, they will not answer a simple question unless you pay them. They must know what issues are plaguing their equipment but fain surprise when you tell them. Then, rather than admit they have a problem and wish to help you resolve it, they want to charge you to problem solve.

I've lost over $4000 in profits in less than a few months just because the laptop decides to shut off when it wants too. Freezing everything first and NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOVER ANYTHING once you restart it. Even if I saved the files before anything happens, it only ""remembers"" it from an hour prior. I've called numerous times, and even tried making a complaint. Instead, they transfer me to 6 different agents, whom I have to repeat EVERYTHING over again, and then keep me on hold until I've had enough of waiting for over 45 minutes. I even called head office in California and they transferred me back to the same people, whom then transferred me another 6 times. NO ONE HELPED ME. The agents wasted my time by going in to my computer and ""updating"" everything AND still the problem is the same. I tell them that, their response was ""O.K. ma'am, I'll call you tomorrow"" ???? I spoke to the Geek Squad that the store initially where I bought it, includes them to repair, etc. After wasting my time with them, they had told me to contact HP as it's a hardware problem, and that's the explanation of where this fraudulent company begins with me.

"dict","I recently purchased an HP Pavilion 2016 model, i7-600T CPU, 2gb HDD, wifi, etc, etc. Do not buy from HP, EVER. Run as fast and far as you can from their products, because if you want anything other than a basic b*tch desktop that will not be upgradable in any way and will fail on you within a year, with HP, you are out of luck. Their horrendous proprietary chassis design makes upgrade essential components like the PSU (this model comes with an abysmal 180w PSU) or a graphics card (the above mentioned PSU sits RIGHT above the expansion slot for the GPU) unbelievably aggravating if not downright impossible. The specs on the tower sent are, in many ways, different than what was advertised (an M.2 A expansion slot for a solid state drive was advertised, with the W-lan/bluetooth advertised as being integrated into the motherboard; what was delivered had the wifi/bluetooth occupying the M.2 A socket, negating its use as an expansion slot; e.g. HP straight out lies to their customers). And don't for a second think you will get any help from HP's ""technical/customer support"", which cannot even rightly be called that. You will spend hours on the phone with different disinterested and untrained people in Indian who are incomprehensible, and straight out admit on the phone that they are not trained for ANY sort of technical support. Wanna work around that by calling HP's HQ in Palo Alto? Hah, then you'll find out that the are importing the disinterested and untrained workers from India here to the states, because you will not find ANYONE who speaks comprehensible English, let alone who can actual help you (or cares to; time after time while on the phone with these troglodytes, it was made abundantly clear that they have NO interest in helping any HP customer; they just try to keep you busy and calling back until your basic b warranty expires). There very little in the way of redeeming qualities about this product, and absolutely NO redeeming qualities about HP as a company. If you have to buy a bre-built, then buy ASUS, by Lenovo, buy ANYTHING but an HP product; if you do buy from HP, you time, money, and sanity will suffer as a result, I guarantee it.","review","english","HP","thebair","3","2016-12-15T11:07:50.000+00:00","If you buy from HP, you are wasting your time and money","1"

"dict","I bought a laptop last year and it needed repair.  Since it was still under warranty I went though that channel.  They screwed up my address (didn't even include it on their shipping label so Fedex contacted me), and now I've discovered through their online tracking system that they shipped my repaired laptop back to themselves!!!!!  I specifically included correct shipping instructions to avoid this.  After 4 attempts in a row of going through their automated system, talking to a human being that needs to transfer me to the person I actually need to speak to and getting disconnected, I finally spoke to a call center supervisor.  He is escalating the situation to corporate and emailed the department I needed to contact.  He promised to call me back within the next couple of hours with an update.   Well, not only did that not happen, but when I called again this morning I found out that there was no person by that name in a supervisory role.  Two more calls today and finally after a lot of sleuthing to find an actual phone number  here in the US, I did talk to someone locally.  What actually yielded results was via contacting the CEO from their website.  Not the results I had hoped for (I wanted my computer delivered by Saturday) but it is being shipped.  Not sure if it will arrive Monday or Tuesday and of course I have no idea if they even repaired my computer.   I can't believe I have spent almost 7 hours trying to resolve a simple shipping issue that HP caused in the first place and didn't resolve when I brought it to their attention.  I will never buy another HP product again based on this experience.  Update 11/15/16.   I did finally get my laptop back, but they didn't return my ac power adapter (why they needed it to be sent in the first place I'll never know).

"dict","I only dealt with a couple of people who were ""rude"" (one in particular), but the level of incompetency and inability to reach pertinent human beings in a timely manner deserves a negative star rating.  On September 11, my HP Envy Phoenix desktop wouldn't wake up from sleep.  I called HP's tech support and after a ridiculous amount of time navigating through automated menus and holding, was connected to a rude woman with a difficult-to-understand accent who insisted that before I could be helped, I had to purchase their ""Smart Friend"" service.  $49.00 and a year's subscription later, I get transferred to several different people, none of whom were able to get the computer back up.  This wasted a couple of hours.  Finally they tell me they're going to send out recovery disks so that I can re-install the OS.  I'm also told that I shouldn't have been made to purchase the Smart Friend service, and I was able to initiate a refund process - yet another circle of telephone hell - I'll just say that I finally did receive the refund, but with the time wasted and stress involved, I should've gotten back double what I was owed.  I receive the disks on September 14, and attempt to load them into the disk drive on the 16th (knowing it wouldn't be a short process, I waited until Friday to deal with it), but the tray won't stay in - it keeps ejecting without even attempting to read the disk.  I hold it shut, and it just sits there - the disk isn't spinning.  So I spend a couple more hours on the phone, increasingly frustrated with the automated menus and lack of results or even knowledge.  At the end of it, I'm told I'll have to send the machine to HP to have them fix it.  Fine.  The shipping materials arrive on Monday the 19th, and I pack it up and ship it out that same day.  On Monday the 26th, I come home from work to find a voicemail from ""Jessie"" at the repair center saying that they couldn't find anything wrong with the machine!  It was working perfectly!!  He asked me to please call him back so he could get more information, so I tried, in vain, to do so.  Calling the number left in the voicemail, I'm again connected to someone in India or wherever the call center is, and when I tell him I need to speak with Jessie at the repair center because he asked me to call, I'm told that ""this is not possible"".  What??  Are you kidding me?!  So the person on the phone says he'll make sure to get a message to Jessie and have him try calling me at a different number.  I never get a call back, but I do receive an email the following day telling me that my computer has been shipped back to me.  I receive it on Wednesday, the 28th, and wait until that Saturday to even take it out of the box.  At this point I'm dreading having anything more to do with it.  Once I do deal with it, amazingly it does boot up - evidently they went ahead and re-installed the OS, even though they ""couldn't find anything wrong with it"".  Only whatever they've done has made it incompatible with my backup and system image I'd created two weeks prior to the computer failing.  So at least I have a working computer, with the exception of the disk drive, which is still kaput.  I'll have to take it to a local repair shop to get it fixed, because even with it being under warranty, there's no way I'm going through HP for anything anymore as it's obviously utterly useless.  I absolutely do NOT recommend HP - this has been, hands-down, the worst ""customer service"" experience of my life!  Deplorable!

"dict","At the end of July 2016 for various reasons I decided to upgrade my hardware given that a lot of it was out of date. I also recently started a small business and needed a laptop that would be good to travel with. Additionally, some of my consulting clients require me to use their hardware, which meant that I was also interested in a dock that could handle a 4K monitor and at the same time provide me with a single cable connection to the various computers I am required to work off.  As such, after a lot of research, I settled on the 15inch HP X360 Spectre, and after some additional research (and while in the US) I purchased a HP ZBook dock 200W version. I read the documentation quite extensively before buying the dock as there were not many that could handle the specifications I was looking for, but this one seemed to be capable. I will highlight that nowhere in the documentation does it provide any compatibility list for the dock (and that should be a hint as to some of the problems I have been having). Since these purchases, I have regretted every minute of buying HP. The irony is that I am actually not unhappy with the laptop. Sure the screen in hindsight is a bit too big for a 2in1 laptop and the keyboard could have been better constructed for what is a premium notebook, but it is relatively light and well designed in most other areas.  My issue is around the customer service that I received when something went wrong! Here is my experiance: - end of July purchased the 2 items. - early August realised that something was not working on the dock (basically, when I plugged it in I received no acknowledgement of anything happening in the way of a on light or a sound by the computer or monitor to acknowledge the cable being plugged in. The on/off power button did absolutely nothing!). This should be realised in the context of having used many docks in the past particularly at work, and particularly Lenovo designed. - at this point I was not concerned ... I purchased HP while in the US as a UK resident as HP is a global organisation and I assumed that they would have suitable support worldwide. - I contacted the provided support number, and after going through a hopeless voice activated menu that I quickly learnt to ignore and press '0' repeatedly, I ended up with their 'first tier' team who I believe are based in India. To be positive about them, I can't accuse them of being rude ... but they seemingly know less than I do about their own products, and to date have practically ignored every commitment they have made to me along the way (not telephoning back, not sending products they told me they were going to send etc etc ...). - the first problem was finding the dock in their worldwide database. Although the product code etc was all correct, the serial number appeared to be completely absent. However after a week or so and after sending pictures to verify the device and purchase, they accepted it and we commenced the problems. - I was away for 2 weeks, so I asked to arrange the part to be replaced when I returned. This didn't happen automatically, so I called back to arrange this. About a week later it arrived. I tested it and it did exactly the same as the first dock ... nothing ...!! There was also no power cable sent, so I tested the dock PSU with the laptop and visa versa with the laptops PSU and laptop was powered but dock still failed. - I called back, spoke to a new agent with a new ticket number, and he decided that the new device must also be faulty. As you might imagine, I starting to wonder whether these docks are all faulty if I have had the misfortune of  receiving 2 broken ones. The agent told me that he would send another one out. - at some point along this process I was then called by a 'tier two' agent to check I was happy. However, I made it clear that I was yet to receive a part that worked, so would be 'happy' when that happened. However, when I called the next time to find out about my issues, this agent had closed my case ... and set it as 'resolved'!! Clearly that 'error' was put right.  - the next time I called was a week later as I was still waiting, I called and the new agent told me the new dock should have arrived by now. However, they immediately agreed to send another one out without any questions, which made me wonder whether they had not sent the previous one ... given they would likely have tracking information to follow. (I have never received that particular promised item). I was however promised that the new item would be with me in 2-3 business days. - It arrived at least a week later. ... and it too did not work!! At this point I was suggesting that maybe there was a problem with the power supply. The agent didn't provide me with a particularly coherent response, but seemed to imply they needed to look into the matter further. At this point I started looking for contact numbers on HP.com to talk to a different 'customer service' department. However, they don't seemingly have such a department. In fact they seem to be setup in multiple independent small businesses that all sell as HP but are separate legal entities ... as when I started calling different departments to ask them to put me through to a customer service team that might be more helpful ... they fobbed me off with the argument that they are not connected with the team who were 'helping me'. However, on calling their online store sales team, for the first time one of them seemed to provide me with the most explanatory argument I had received. Basically they said that my laptop was a premium consumer product and the 'dock' was a premium business product. The two are incompatible. - on putting that to the agents who had been supporting me, they seemed to ignore it and told me that a new power supply was on order and being shipped to me. I said to them I would wait for this, and it was apparently on a 1 day delivery. That delivery I am yet to receive over 2 weeks later! - My final straw was being promised 'the most senior' manager to call me last week. They never did. I then called a few days later and when I promised to write this review and post it as far and wide as I could, I then did speak with a manager. However, they promised me a conversation with a UK based manager (who I believe was 'keeping an eye' on my case ... and the ultimatum for that conversation was yesterday ... another 3 days later. It is now 10 weeks later and I am still no better off than when I started this process!  To summarise: I have a laptop that is functional and I'm reasonably happy with. BUT a non-functional dock. A complete chaotic mess of technical and customer service (it's worth adding that they had serial numbers of both products from essentially the start ... so if they are incompatible, then clearly the technical knowledge of the technical team leaves a lot to be desired)!

"dict","I ordered a high end HP spectre laptop from HP Canada online store and here is what happened next  Day 1 - No automatic confirmation email , I found this odd but thought OK it will arrive soon  Day 2 - Still no confirmation email so I call their customer service and after a lot of questions , they locate my order and say its 'on hold ' pending HP security clearance for my business credit card . No clear explanation as to why this is required as my credit card has plenty credit on it and such security clearance is not usually needed . The customer service agent reassures me that the HP security service will phone me tomorrow to confirm that I am the owner of the credit card  Day 3 - No phone call so I go online to check my order status only to find it has been CANCELLED !!! , so I call HP and speak to a robotic individual who asks me my name and address SIX times and then says that my order was cancelled as they could not confirm that the credit card was owned by me !!! ( It is a company card with both my husbands and my businesses name on it, and they just did not seem to be able to get that concept ) .  I pointed out that we have used that credit card several times with no problem and yes I own the card and HP security never even bothered to pick up the phone to confirm my ownership of the card , they just went and CANCELLED my order without a blind bit of notice and absolutely no communication .  This is in sharp contrast to the service I recently received when I bought an 27inch Apple iMAC on line . Apple texted me everyday to update me on my order status and even offered an apple agent to visit my business to show my team how to use it !!

"dict","I have a HP printer, which is out of warranty. I bought a new laptop with WIndows 10 and the CD driver I had no longer works. Although Windows 10 allows me to do basic print, I could not do more advanced settings.  So I tried to call HP. For a start, it is very difficult to find their number. WHen I finally called, one very kind support staff tried to help and sent me the link for drivers. It worked and I could download, but it was in Chinese, and all the drop down boxes did not work. So I called up again, and a support operative called Ramona kept reading back to me that my printer is out of warranty and she cannot help me unless she puts me through to tech support which I have to pay All I am asking for is the right drivers which I cannot find on the site myself for my model. But this is too much to ask. I would now rather throw away my HP Printer (which is still working) and buy a Canon or something else than to pay HP any more money. I am disgusted with HP's sell to you and junk you attitude. And I asked Ramona whether I could feedback on their service for their internal support team, but I could not. Obviously HP does not care.

I tried contacting HP for customer service under warranty. Whenever, I rang the number, it was constantly engaged and the message ""We are experiencing an unusually high volume of calls, please try again later"". Then after a few seconds, the line went dead. So unable to get through to HP Customer service. So I went on to the Resolver site and as if by magic, a day later I received an email from HP, giving me a number to ring. This number does not appear on the website! Despite having purchased the netbook online, HP didn't have my details and demanded a proof of purchase, so I had to email them the receipt they had raised and emailed to me!  I then spent an hour on the phone going over the problem with an HP agent, who kept asking me the same questions over and over again. I demanded to be put through to a supervisor. When they went through my contact details, I told them to amend them with the new information. They failed to do this, then claimed that they had tried to contact me to arrange to pick up my netbook. I replied to the email asking them what number they had used. That was 10 days ago and I am still waiting for a reply. I have spent ££thousands over the years with HP.

"dict","Purchased a desktop all-in-one Pavilion PC last August. Began experiencing erratic BSODs in April. Called HP three times to troubleshoot; first two calls they kept recommending to reinstall my OS and follow a list of steps which I had already tried. So I tried recovering to an older checkpoint, reinstalling my OS, and re-upgrading to Win10. Still BSODs. The third time they suggested a deep diagnostic check instead of fast diagnostic check (which I had run twice previously without error) which finally identified that there was a hard drive failure.   So, I was transferred to an agent who was supposed to walk me through returning the product. She had absolutely no idea what she was saying and was very clearly reading off a piece of paper, in monotone, with no interest. When I asked her questions about the process she didn't know what to respond because it wasn't on her sheet of paper and just repeated what she said again. A ten minute call turned into thirty excruciating minutes of waiting while she repeated the same things over and over. Eventually, they shipped an empty box to the wrong address (but thankfully my local postman figured out the error).   I returned my computer, including the power cable and adapter, because I was not instructed otherwise. A few days later they returned my computer without the cable and adapter. I called in to tell them that I couldn't turn on the computer as I had no cable. They sent me the cable, not the adapter. I called again to get the missing part. The dispatch told me they needed a hardware supervisor to approve sending the part that HP failed to send back to me, but the hardware supervisor was too busy to be available, and that they would need to call back and speak to me in person (e.g. waste even more time, unnecessarily). So, I set up a time for a callback at 9am and left two contact numbers. No call was received at that time (or hours after that time) on either number. Now I am calling again, going through dispatch, and waiting on hold for the hardware supervisor in order to get the missing part.   All of this would have been VERY clearly and easily avoided if that first person handling the returns had actually provided the information she should have provided. What a waste of time. I don't even know if the repair even worked yet, weeks after I received my product back, because I can't power the thing on. Worst customer service ever.   **Edit: Forgot to mention. While waiting interminably on hold with one of the reps he asked me which OS and antivirus I used on my computer. I said I had originally upgraded to Win10 and used Avast and Malwarebytes. He said Oh. You should get a subscription with McAfee because this is the ""only antivirus that is currently compatible with Windows 10"".   Excuse me? Windows 10 has been out for months. There are PLENTY of antivirus softwares that have been updated to be compatible with Windows 10, including Avast.   I called the rep out on his obvious lie and said I didn't have any need for a subscription. He didn't say any more about peddling antiviruses after that and went back to handling my case.  Be warned that HP representatives apparently condone spreading patently incorrect information in order to sell antivirus subscriptions.","review","english","HP","B","1","2016-06-25T17:31:57.000+00:00","epic incompetence AND misinformation to increase antivirus sub sales","1"

"dict","I recently received a new HP laptop and after a few weeks it just went off with no Waring whilst I was actually using it.   Turns out it was a faulty Motherboard. These things happen however this repair took the hard drive with it wiping all my data. Again whilst being rubbish these things happen. After being online trying to get help with HP who's staff do not listen and obviously don't understand what is being said. This took over an hour of explaining. The girl even tried to sell me recovery media for a laptop that would not even boot to the BIOS let alone the Operating system. Ok that whilst being shocking again these things happen. I was told that it would be sent collected and repaired as it was under warranty.   This repair took about a week and was returned by the UK's (leading?) courier company DPD. These diligent delivery champions delivered my laptop back with a hole in the box and the plastics smashed. I got straight back on to HP who after much back and forth including pictures agreed it should go back.    This time I have been told it after HP had it for a week have said it will be a further two weeks. So I have been without the new laptop for 2 weeks and wont expect it back for 2 more.   This is pathetic HP wont acknowledge this is a problem and will not do anything else except leave me without the laptop.  I tried to get help on Facebook. They were very happy to do a song and dance about helping in public but once you PM them then its we cant help and it will take 4 days to get back to you etc etc. Do not buy HP as there product are not the best and there support is nonexistent.","review","english","HP","Brian Milne","1","2016-05-15T14:13:05.000+00:00","More bad Service as bad if not worse than Zavvi or DPD","1"

"dict","I loved the little HP Envy 14 laptop that I bought used, but still under warranty. Just before the warranty ran out, HP sent me a come-on e-mail to sell me an extended warranty. It seemed like a good idea, since I liked the box, so I sent them several hundred bucks. I had some difficulty registering the warranty online or getting it to hook in with my existing warranty, which I had used once to update the BIOS.  A few months later, I had overheating problems, so I figured I'd replace the fan under warranty. NOT SO FAST! First they said I was out of warranty. Then they demanded proof of purchase of the extended warranty. When I provided that, then they claimed it was not valid—perhaps because it would not register properly? And they also wanted proof of purchase OF THE LAPTOP. Look, it's registered with HP under my name, it's been tweaked under warranty before, all you have to do is figure out how to apply the extended warranty WHICH I HAVE PAID CASH MONEY FOR.  Meanwhile, this futile conversation is proceeding by delayed e-mail, each time with another person in Bangladore with no authority—especially when I say, ""Fine. You're not going to honor the warranty, so just give me back the money I paid you for this extended warranty WHICH YOU PROPOSED IN THE FIRST PLACE, ya mooks, and I'll just buy my own damn fan."" Nope uh-uh go way.  I had been an HP guy since 1987, when their laser printers cost $1,500 and their 286 Vista machines could total five figures.

"dict","After having to deal with Virgin Media and EE I thought I had reached the depths of poor customer service ... how wrong I was... HP have to be the most arrogant mofos I have ever had to deal with.   My laptop started to experience sound issues, so I used the chat support, which I have as the unit is still under warranty, the technicians were next to useless and ended up causing more problems, instead of fixing the issue I had. After many promised callbacks which never materialised, I finally got to speak to someone called Adele (how ironic) who was the most senior person I could speak to, or so I was told, Adele told me that my only option was to send the laptop for repair, so I had to give in and send it off. Adele also promised an email to apologise for the poor customer service I had received, maybe I am wrong in expecting a little more than an email)... I have never received that email... from the most senior person in the customer service department (allegedly).   I was quite impressed when it was returned after 5 days... I was NOT impressed when I opened the (undamaged) packaging to find a dent in the metal body, near the vents, that was not there when it was sent. I immediately called up but could not speak with the, oh so senior, Adele, but was “helped” by Jesse who asked me to send in lots of pics and told me that she would get Adele, who is dealing with the case, to call me within 8 hours, this happened on Monday and I am still, as yet, to receive this call ... from the most senior person in the customer service department (allegedly).   So again I was promised a callback within 8 hours from Adele, and again I had to call HP, and I finally got to speak to the “most senior person in the customer service department” Adele. I have been given the options of 1. Sending my laptop back for repair 2. ... there is no 2. After damaging my laptop they refuse to give me a refund (I really want no dealings with the company again) or a new replacement. I was offered an extended warranty by way of an apology... I am still under warranty and this is what I have to go through to get “support”.   It got to the point that I had to request my case be reviewed by another member of the customer relations team as Adele was not helping, calling back when promised, or following up on emails. The case was reviewed by Luke, another ""most senior person in the customer service department"" and after a long call telling me MANY times how much he appreciated my problem and all the issues I had had and apologised numerous times... he then told me I HAD to send my laptop for the second repair and then more options would become available. Luke also promised he would be ""with me throughout the whole process"" and would call me at every stage of the collection, repair and return process, I was also assured I would be sent pictures of my unit when it arrived at the repair centre and again when it was leaving the repair centre.  My laptop was collected from the office I work out of once a week, but Luke was not there for me, he did not call, and the promised photos did not arrive when the unit arrived at the repair centre. It then took 3 calls and emails to find out why I had not been contacted by Luke. I was told it on the phone that it was due to Lukes personal problems and by email that is was internal issues. If Luke had contacted me he would have known that the laptop should not be delivered to the office I work in once a week.... this then meant waiting another 3 days to get the laptop delivered to my home.   Due to the personal/internal problems I, once again, asked for my case to be reviewed and moved to another ""most senior person in the customer service department"".   When my laptop was returned for a second time, there was still damage present from the first repair and I immediately sent photos showing the damage to HP... I was then contacted by Kirsten who finally agreed to give me a refund (but HP don't do refunds so it had to be called a ""buy back"") at full purchase value. Collection of my unit was sorted and I sent my receipt in to confirm the value to a person called Gergana in Switzerland (tax avoidance anybody?? Wink ) I was also told it can take up to 19 calendar days for the refund to be processed. You can probably guess that 19 days came and went as they are having technical problems in the finance back office (guess they are using HP equipment)   I am still, at this time, waiting for my refund.   I am at a loss as to why HP will not offer me any compensation for the long running, 8 week, case or for the fact that the refund was not processed when promised. Luke claims that HP operate a policy of not offering compensation, but in the same breath says that it depends on the case.   So we are now one week on from the agreed date of my refund and I am sick of being lied to.   I was told on Wednesday 13th April that I should expect the refund to show in my account by Friday 15th April and that Luke would call me on Thursday and Friday to check if the money had been received, no money, no calls.   I spoke with Adele ( the person that was initially dealing with my case), and I was told that Luke had authorised my 'Fast Track' payment on the 13th April and it was only authorised on the 15th, the date Luke had told me I would recieve my money, I have been told, by Adele, that I now have to wait till Wednesday 20th April a whole 28 days since my refund was processed.   I was also told by Luke that he had no influence over the back office systems, yet Adele has informed me that it was Luke that had authorised the payment. I am either confused or being lied to, I do not get confused easily.  One final point HP have blocked me on all social media for broadcasting my disgust.","review","english","HP","Justin Pywell","1","2016-04-18T11:09:53.000+00:00","Hideously Poor Customer Service","1"

"dict","I placed an order over the phone on the 30th of October 2015, the product was confirmed as available and the order was processed.  The estimated delivery date was the 8th of November 2015 and the item was confirmed as ""Packing"" the week before. However on the delivery date I was told the item was actually not available with no date for when it would be. After speaking to customer services directly I was told the product would be available in the new year so I decided to wait.  After Christmas the estimated delivery date changed to the 21st of January 2016 and then after New Year changed to the 14th of January so all seemed okay.  However again three days before delivery I received an email from their customer services manager Vivienne saying that she was unable to give a concrete date for delivery, she did however kindly offer to let me purchase an inferior product for a higher price!  I tried to speak to Vivienne but despite being the customer services manager she refuses to speak to customers directly. Although a member of her team did inform me that they can only confirm the delivery date of a product when it has actually left their warehouse!

"dict","I purchased a top of the range HP Envy notebook about a year or so ago which I loved. Near the end of the warranty period it developed a fault. I contacted HP's customer service (UK) and they were eager to help me. The very friendly staff talked me through several steps over the phone to try help me fix the problem. Unfortunately it appeared to be a hardware issue and so could not be fixed over the phone. They told me they'd send a courier to my home to collect and securely package my notebook the following day and would return it to me as ASAP.

"dict","I had a laptop in perfect working condition that was out of warranty.  I ""rolled back"" from Windows 10 to my original Windows 7 Pro, but in the process lost my BIOS.  When I contacted MS, they referred me to HP.  I was on the HP website looking for a resolution when I realized my electric cord had been RECALLED due to a fire hazard!  This might explain why my battery failed so quickly.  My HP Assistant never worked, so I was unable to utilize that tool to repair the BIOS, BUT I found a product named Insyde which flashes and fixes your BIOS.  The directions on how to use Insyde was missing details on what numbers to enter into the slots, not to mention the RECALLED fire hazard, so I decided it would be best to call and get guidance.  I called customer service and was told I would have to PAY for them to replace the cord, get assistance repairing the HP Assistant and answer questions regarding their software that wasn't very detailed.  After hours of phone calls and emails, I finally was assigned a case manager named Ruth.  After exchanging emails, screenshots and calls, she finally replaced the cord and battery then had a technician call; however, he was rude, hard to understand and didn't know how to use the software Insyde either.  I asked him to fix the HP Assistant, but he was unable to even do that so I thanked him, but declined to allow him to do anything further with my laptop.  I again went back to email with Ruth as I wanted a paper trail as well as screenshots to prove everything and requested another technician.  The same one called back.  I told her I would be happy to allow him to proceed if she would warranty his work, she declined, but offered to send me complementary recovery discs since I had restored my laptop 2x already without resolving the issue.  She said the recovery discs should fix it.  I received the discs, transferred all files to another PC prior to using them just in case, then used them.  My laptop is now stuck in a recovery grey screen.  I took screenshot with a phone and contacted HP who basically said ""Sorry, it's out of warranty.""  I went to the BBB and filed a complaint....HP then offered a 1yr extended warranty on a new HP computer if I were to buy one.  It appears HP must be having serious financial issues as everything they do requires milking customers for every single dollar they can get!  I have screenshots and emails to backup EVERYTHING I say!  This is NOT slander.....this is fact!

"dict","10 months ago, I bought this laptop from HP named 15-g002AX. Why this model? Well it was called the most affordable gaming laptop at Rs 34,000 by several sites and seemed like it would fulfill my basic needs too like a little programming and photo editing. Sadly the person for whom the gaming part of the device was meant disappeared just a few months later.  The laptop worked OK mostly, but never ran like it was the big bad machine it was advertised to be. And when it didn't work fine. I would open up HP software and select chat support and just sit there, waiting. Nobody from their side ever joined and I would let it run for hours or complain through the feedback. Eventually I would just give up and go to any popular non-HP PC forum and get help in a day at most. This whole process happened three times.  But that wasn't the last time the laptop glitched. I thought I should use the forums from HP themselves this time. My eyes bled. It was the worst designed website I had ever seen. The registration process was really bugged and had to be repeated a couple of times before it worked. And the ways the forums was divided into topics was so confusing that I decided to go back to my previous choices. Though they have redesigned it a bit you can still see how terrible it is.  The above services require you to be in warranty to be free.  Let me explain to you how the laptop's screen is made. It is composed of a REALLY cheap, weak and brittle plastic. The toys you played with 10 years ago are still more sturdy than this [removed]. Two pieces of plastic that hold the screen together are snapped to each other by small buttons and the rest is just glued to each other using fevistik.  I believed it cannot get any worse from there. But starting from mid-september the display decided to give up. There are no screws and consequently it would often need to be snapped back because it cannot handle the lid being opened at normal speed. One day the lid just wouldn't open, and using force would start making the plastic pieces separate and the fevistik to come off. I saw that the inner plastic had broke off from one of the hinges in a suspiciously straight line . So I let it remain closed and took it it to an HP authorised seller+service-centre because it wasn't far. The main old bald dude there welcomed me in as if I were the PM. When I told him I had come to get my notebook fixed which was in the car at that time, he was a completely different person. Well I took it in and a bunch of young guys just started to look at. I told them what the problem was and warned them not to use force to open the lid(I had to prevent one of them from doing just that anyway later and he said he forgot). The main guy went silent, asked If I had accidential-damage-warranty. I told him that it comes under normal warranty which I was careful enough to update after I bought it online.  He began by saying that it was a physical damage therefore it won't be covered under normal warranty. I laughed. Then he decided that it was accidental damage instead and therefore I have to pay.  I gave the following facts:        The plastic broke from inside and in a very obscure place. Very unlikely to happen from a fall or anything.        There were zero scratches or cracks or any kind of marks anywhere, which should have been if there were any kind of accident.        The screen is just too thin to hold by(he was trying to accuse me of [removed]) and the lower part is much much heavier.        The rest was just me telling him that I only opened and closed the lid normally and I'm very careful with such things and this could have only arisen from a manufacturing defect.      ""Dekhiye aap meri baat sun nahi rahe(You're not listening to me)"" He repeated this same line God-knows how many times. He would never reply to my points or queries. Then at one point he called me a miser for buying it online.  I asked him how that invalidates the warranty or reduces the amount of money HP gets through the sale.  ""Dekhiye aap meri baat sun nahi rahe"".  I asked him to give me one possible way in which the laptop could have broke exactly the way it did and by accident.  ""Dekhiye aap meri baat sun nahi rahe"".  At the end all the ""technicians"" decided to join in and mumble at the same time. I was debating with children. Bald guy gives me the HP customer care number and warns me that I'm making him angry. I went home.  It won't be surprising but the customer care helpline was terrible too. I held for an hour and then someone told me that the department that would deal with this was on holiday and I should submit a case. I booted up my 9 year old desktop with an even older CRT monitor and decided to do it online. It took some time but I submitted it through chat. Every HP website is badly designed. Anyways so a technician came two days later, completely opened up the display and both hinges, and took some pictures. I asked him what his verdict is. He would just hint that he believed I broke it myself. I gave him the above facts, he said everyone who breaks something finds an excuse but it is not him that has to decide weather it comes in warranty or not.  He said that if I had ADP he would have fixed it right there immediately. Yeah I remember getting ""special"" offers for ADP and extended warranties every week on my email. I still think both of those things are [removed]. A week later I lose my patience and call to ask when somebody would come and fix this. They said it wasn't covered in warranty and I have to submit a new case. They said it was the technician who decides if it is an accident or manufacturing defect. Nobody wants to hold any responsibility.  My hands hurt so I'll just skip by saying that they wanted 10,000 Rs for the job. Which is completely insane and nearly 30% of the cost of laptop, just for glueing a new [removed] plastic cover on the screen.  This is Planned obsolescence/failure and pure evil at it's worst. You don't know how bad I feel. I have to be compulsively obsessive about keeping all my devices clean, bugless and without even scratches. I did everything I could to keep it safe because I valued it very much. Warranties seem to have no meaning, God-knows what they cover.  And that's not the only device we had that behaved this way. The android I bought 5 months ago is mysteriously getting sluggier and it's battery too quickly depleting even though I barely have a handful of apps on it, most of them disabled, even thought it is advertised ""built to last"". The other two androids of my siblings are even worse off.  I have nothing against people who love buy new a new model for their phone every sunday and a new PC whenever the weather changes, But I want my things to last. My needs are few and I haven't yet seen a technological breakthrough or some actual innovation in these things that I actually needed. None of that matters because all devices have a timer of some kind and there's nobody on my side who objects to this obviously widespread corporate greed. There's barely any point to write a review specifically for the model because it is ""old"" under a pile of new models that came every other day after I bought it and nobody is going to see it.  HP is supposed to be like the top company and their products and services are no different than that of chinese brands. The laptop is working for now but I have a strong feeling it won't for long, because it is not supposed to. I don't know where I'll go from there, which brand to try next and I'm scared I won't see much difference.   HP has sent me atleast 5 emails asking for my feedback after this. Just google around and see how much the company is hated for these exact things(which I didn't know about before buying). If none of them made HP change anything, I guess they are just sadistic and like angry feedback as their food.","review","english","HP","jack's mental breakdown","1","2015-10-30T20:05:48.000+00:00","Planned obsolescence and after-sales service","1"

"dict","Edit:  Finally got a call from someone that could explain the situation and offer a solid solution.  I bumped up from one to three stars based on HP finally making the situation right.  However, as long as there is a call-center barrier where issues are not able to be heard by the proper people of the company, HP will always have frustrated customers and I will keep two stars off for that reason.  “Order # H395529548  In all of my years of positive and negative online shopping experiences, I have never encountered a more frustrating and infuriating experience. Long story short, the product I ordered had to be altered because they found an incompatibility (or simply ran out of the item they listed as an option on their order form), they offered to switch the item out for another but offered less than half of what the switch should have been, they then delayed the order twice, finally canceling the order due to a vague reason that I haven't been able to find someone to explain. All the while, I've spent hours on the phone trying to figure out each hurdle with call-center employees in India who give generic spiels and cannot get you ahold of higher level HP employee that can offer real answers and solutions. Not only have I wasted my time, I've had to take the initiative to find out what was going on.  The first delay came with an email notifying me of the delay 3 days after the item was supposed to have shipped. The downgrade, and being offered less than half of what I should have received for the downgrade, required hours of my communication with call-center employees who had to be told time and time again that I was not requesting a discount, but rather proper compensation for the downgrade. After I called to find out why my computer still has not shipped and request a further discount for my troubles, I received an email immediately following that phone call saying that HP has cancelled my order giving a vague and generic explanation. They held my money for over a month and made me waste hours of time resolving their false advertisements, and inabilities to deliver their promised product. And now I'm sitting here with nothing more than a sorry and what was supposed to be a good deal, gone. My rebate will no longer work. I've requested that HP honor the discount and rebate offer, for the same computer which continues to be advertised, but the call-center employees do not have to authority to give that discount. And I'm still waiting for a non-call-center employee to contact me as there's no way I can contact them.  HP has distanced themselves from the customer by using foreign call-center employees as the front line. They've supplied them with American first names and a script to help them sound like they can solve your problem. But unless your problem is the most surface level of issues, you aren't going to get anywhere. They simply don't have the ability to make decisions other than what HP has outlined in their job description. They also cannot describe HPs vague emails about the issues they have making, shipping, and delivery their product. It's a horrible way of doing business and these unfortunate people have to deal with the poor business practices by the HP higher-ups. I've exhausted my abilities to find a a solution and discuss this matter with someone who has any bit of authority. AVOID HP AT ALL COSTS.

Day 25: I call HP and ask why nobody showed up. We agree a new date two days later.  Day 27: Again, nobody shows up to pick up my laptop, which has been broken for one month.  Day 28: I call HP again to ask why my laptop didnt get picked up. Im told its probably because it was bought in France and I should contact HP France. Here we go again.

"dict","HP is gifting customers with Reebok Gift Vouchers on purchase of 12A laser printer gift cartridges. I had got 7, Rs.500 gift vouchers from buying HP cartridges last year. I went to shop for a pair of sneakers at your South City Mall Store Kolkata, INDIA  outlet. So I wished to pay for the shoes with ""Reebok Vouchers"" (valid till Jan-2013). To my utter surprise &amp; disbelief the store personnel refused from accepting those. He said that the company has instructed them not to accept gift vouchers. I tried shopping at the Chowringhee road kolkata shop but they said the same thing to me. This is really a scam. I emailed hp Asia Pacific and they did not respond. I wrote on Reebok India's wall regarding this and they have not responded either. This is unfair business practice.","review","english","HP","Priyankar Mukherjee","1","2013-12-20T13:15:52.000+00:00","Gift Vouchers with HP 12A cartridges dishonoured by Reebok.","1"

I have contacted them repeatedly at my cost, sent them log data, and set-up info, only to be told the tech support worker could not work out what was wrong. I had to tell them how IP protocols work and that the printer is not compatable with Vista or Kaspersky.

"dict","Before Christmas I went to the HP online store to order a HP Pavilion Slimline s5102uk. I was looking for a small PC to use with a large flat screen TV. Given it was advertised with HDMI ports, well priced and HP equipment is generally well made I ordered the item.  Item arrived and having checked over it, I noticed that the advertised graphics card that provides HDMI was missing. After phoning several times and finally getting an answer, HP agreed to send a replacement item. This duly arrived and again was missing the HDMI port. I eventually managed to get this item returned and finally got my money back after 1 month of hassle.  In summary, their products are good and reasoably well made. However give the online store as wide a berth as you can possibly manage and either by an HP product from a shop where you can see it and lift it yourself off a shop or try one of their many competitors, all of whom provide a much better customer service to their online customers.","review","english","HP","Robert Baker","2","2010-08-15T15:43:37.000+00:00","Product did not match description - customer service attrocious","1"
