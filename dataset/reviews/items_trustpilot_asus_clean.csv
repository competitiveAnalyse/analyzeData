"I had an Asus Laptop X555LA, not a bad laptop but problems with drivers for Wifi and USB ports. Contacted customer support for older versions of drivers and all they can suggest is ""FACTORY RESET"". No trouble shooting no diagnosis no nothing. It could be a machine at the other end just tell people with problems to Factory reset. This will be my first and last ASUS.",english,asus,Norm Ledger,1,2018-11-30T15:23:04.000+00:00,I had an Asus Laptop X555LA,1

"Just wish I had looked at reviews before purchasing my Asus laptop and recommending my son to buy the same, which he did.  8 days past the 12 month warranty for battery so not covered  and would be subject to extra charges, which by the sounds of it would be more than I paid for the laptop.  Can't even seem to find the address of their service centres as I can't afford the time to wait, or pay extra charges, for my laptop to be picked up then serviced etc and probably get lost in the system, I thought I would take it direct to a service centre but when I look online I just keep getting referred back to the Asus main page.  Definitely will not buy one of their laptops again and will make sure everyone I know doesn't either",english,asus,Ethel Sumner,9,2018-11-21T20:26:29.000+00:00,Just wish I had looked at reviews…,1
"Router: Good hardware spec, nice interface.Value for the price comparing competition.  Bad: Asked simple question about available option in router's config.

"Writing this whilst waiting for a response from Asus UK and their EU RMA division regarding a high-end (&gt;£500 new) motherboard that has gone faulty within 3-year warranty (18 months in),  but have to echo the one-star comments made by other with regards to the REALLY poor customer service from this company.  I have commenced the RMA process for an expensive motherboard with their Czech division and have received a SECOND-HAND board to replace my faulty item, which is either faulty itself, or has not been refurbished to a very high standard and has clearly had some very heavy use in the past.  The components on their replacement board look tired and worn,  there are traces of dust and 'fluff' in key components and the condition of the replacement board just isn't acceptable.  I cannot understand how a Global Tech' company producing such expensive and leading-edge goods can get away with colourful warranty advertising etc. on their original product packaging, but yet treat customers so badly when there is a genuine component failure.  Buy their products with caution and do not be assured by multi-year warranty when the reality of the RMA process can give you a poor quality replacement (which I will not be using with my expensive CPU !!).  I personally won't buy Asus again.",english,asus,Mike,4,2018-11-19T10:58:27.000+00:00,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - WARRANTY AND RMA REPLACEMENT,1

"Bought the new ASUS widescreen monitor for over £1000.  Within a month a bug crawled in between the backlight and the screen - and died.   The monitor is ruined. There is a big black splodge in the middle of the screen forever.   I completed an ASUS warranty return form onlilne, after which they provided me with a return number,  they informed me to package up the monitor for collection the next day.    The next morning I had an email sent at 0730 hrs informing me the return had been rejected and I was to take pictures of the fault.  I had already packaged the monitor.  I had already arranged for someone to be in all day.   What an utter waste of time that was.   For me- if a bug can climb inside a £1000 monitor, that indicates that it isn't constructed very well, and it isn't really fit for purpose.        After another week I finally received an email stating they were waiting for stock?   two further weeks past and nothing.  I was sent a series obstructive messages giving me a week number (not a calendar date) when they expected stock to be available.   Update:  after being fobbed off repeatedly.  I had no other alternative but to give them 14 days to provide a replacement before I commenced a small claim in the Court.  Amazingly, the next day the replacement monitor arrived.  Its taken them a month to do this.      To add further insult to injury the replacement is a reconditioned / repaired monitor,  I've paid £1000 for a secondhand monitor.  After this experience I will NEVER purchase another ASUS product.       Last but by no means least.....   ASUS use a company called LetMeRepair for the warranty exchanges.  I've never seen a company with lower customer satisfaction feedback.   Read a few of the reviews - you'll see what I mean.",english,asus,Andrew Collis,2,2018-09-28T14:32:42.000+00:00,Bought an ASUS monitor for over £1000 -  ruined by a bug crawling inside it.

"Bought a Laptop from them, Space-bar key starts acting up and the hinge around the screen has a massive gap in it, send it back for RMA. RMA fixed the keyboard but ignored the hinge. Sent it back for the Hinge, Hinge fixed  screen starts to flicker. Called up ASUS Customer support, says I need to send it back for another RMA, does so. Screen fixed Enter key is broken - either they didn't fix it initially or they broke it, file for another RMA, RMA had some issues, so I called up ASUS, but they collected anyways. Checked online, turns out I could've asked for a refund as they already have tried 2 times to fix my laptop, but its too late because it took them a month to reach this point and my 6-month period is over.

"My God, where do I start with this utterly abysmal company? In a nutshell here's a breakdown: 1. Asus Laptop Hybrid died on me. I work in tech, tried to fix but nothing would work.  2. Contacted Asus &amp; 3rd party repair company collected. My computer was in brand new condition. 3. Two weeks later it arrives back to me complete with damage to the outer shell, the track pad &amp; lots of dirt &amp; scratches. 4. Still wouldn't work properly so contacted Asus to complain. 5. Long story short, a year went by for me fighting this damn company tooth &amp; claw for damages &amp; demanding a new replacement but they always made excuses not to compensate me due their 3rd party repairs damage to my computer being MY fault &amp; they refuse to take responsibility. 6. I get involved Trading Standards, Ombudsman &amp; other legal bodies, even my MP (who you'll know from the telly), &amp; ALL take my side &amp; say Asus is breaching its terms &amp; should either compensate or replace. Yet none of them could help as it would involve a long legal battle for me.  I went sadly to my local Currys store to try get a new computer &amp; was asked by manager there what was wrong. I told him. He said where did I buy it from? I said his store. He got his area manager to hear the story. They went away &amp; came back 10 mins later &amp; said even though the returns receipt to them was 9months out, they wanted to be 'the good guys for a change' so proceeded to take the Asus off me &amp; said 'go get a new one to the same value with our compliments!!  WHAT A STAR COMPANY CURRYS IS  🤩 Total respect for them now.  As for Asus (or should that be ANUS 😂), I HAVE TOLD EVERYONE WHO'LL LISTEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA &amp; PERSONAL FRIENDS &amp; THOSE I SEE WANTING TO BUY A COMPUTER I SEE IN A STORE, TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS DREADFUL, ABYSMAL, CONNING, CONNIVING, CRAFTY, DAMN RIGHT CRIMINAL COMPANY.

"G752VY which i spent around 1.2 grand on has just given up in a number of ways, the screen and then constant stuttering and my laptop goes crazy after a period of use and my fans blow out at 100%. I did my first RMA and it got given back with the majority of the issues still there, a  new screen was given but after a week of use a god damn pixel line appeared on it suggesting poor workmanship and issues still persist. The new screen looked far worse compared to my original also. I don't trust my laptop to last or for my laptop to come back in working condition from this second RMA. It is disgusting how poor this laptop lasted and will be looking to take this to small claim courts if needed as i do not want to be left with this laptop. Furthermore, i gave my laptop to my first RMA in immaculate condition, dusty and somewhat dirty but immaculate. I noticed when giving my laptop to DPD for the second RMA that there was scratches all over the laptop bodywork. I am appalled at this service and i ask that you all do not purchase an Asus ROG or any asus products at all if you want something to last without faults. I used to love Asus products but this has made me deter everyone i know from them.  I even found another review on Asus with 1 star with someone with a G752VY also who clearly had the same issues after just 8 months of use. If i used my laptop thoroughly straight away my laptop likely would of died within the year too. This is not an isolated issue.  I sent a complaint to Asus already and if Asus see this review and wishes to contact me please feel free to. Otherwise i will take action in a legal way shortly.

"I made the error of purchasing a T303UA laptop from these cowboys. The machine was good, the build quality was good. All was well until I accidentally cracked the class cover on the lcd. Then I had to try to get it repaired. Trying to get it returned was hard enough, Delays in picking the unit up added a week to the repair time but it eventually went on the 12th of June 2017. A hefty but not unexpected quotation arrived for a new screen and I authorised and paid for the repair the very same day. Now I am waiting for ASUS to deliver a new screen from some far flung part of the world as the 'ETA is the 8/8/2018' after which they will repair and return my unit. They will have had my money for 2 months or more (and the laptop) before I see the machine again. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD TO THROW THE ITEM AWAY",english,asus,K.

Reliability is dismal - the fingerprint sensor, a critical element of the phone,  worked intermittently and stopped working completely after 14 months of use.

"ROG STRIX GL553VD - Manufacturing Defect - ASUS decides to call it CID with no explanation  Got the ROG in july 2017. Got it from AUS online store. Didn't check the device before i landed back in India. Surprisingly they shipped a device with an unpasted trackpad. The thing literally was handing out of place only by the flat cable.  Contact customer support immediately and was told they would send the executive. Surprisingly upon giving them my address, they told me they will charge for visiting and further upon asking the policy of manufacturing defect and quality control, they abandoned the ticket - did not reply back. Since I was able to use the think, I let it go.  After a year, I logged another complaint about servicing and other issues (fading of the screen visible when black), I agreed to pay visiting charge. I also included the original issue of the manufacturing defect of the unpasted trackpad.  They sent a bloody amateur service executive to inspect a ROG. The dude, flipped the laptop to see the S.No. just after loading a disk in the ODD and continued as it spun and scratched with the internals. The guy at first, did not see the issue of the trackpad - clearly showing, he had no experience of a ROG - and asked me what was wrong. I showed him the issue.  He continued to blow my mind by saying ""Sir, Gaming Laptops have faded screens"" when it came to the screen issue. And did not even perform a single system H/W or S/W test to see any other issue with the system. Took the visiting/on-site service charges and reported half of the issue that i told him about, i had to get the remaining items manually added.  ASUS being ASUS, declared the touchpad issue as CID, because they wanted to make money on top and not accept they messed it up since the beginning. I asked why and on what ground are you declaring this as CID, and as usual, ASUS being ASUS, did not say anything and closed the case without even providing me services apart from what they called CID.  So much for Quality Product and Service.  Better get a premium Dell. They at least have better policies and executives in my experience of using XPS for over 5 years.",english,asus,Shantanu Rana,1,2018-11-30T20:37:58.000+00:00,ROG STRIX GL553VD - Manufacturing Defect - ASUS decides to call it CID with no explanation,1

"I bought ASUS ROG STRIX 1080ti for almost 1 000 euro. After 14 months it stopped working - all PC went dark and fans on GPU started to work @ 100% without a reason. After this happened, by accident I touched the fan while it was spinning @ 100% and two blades from the fan got broken. Well, not a problem I thought, cause the problem with the card happened before, the fan got broken, so when I will send it for warranty repair, they will run the test and see, that the broken fan is not causing the problem with the card. ASUS is not some kind of scum company, that will decline your warranty for any reason, right? Wrong! ASUS RMA engineer opened the box, saw two broken blades on one fan, took pictures, closed the box and sent it back. He even pointed with arrows to broken blades, like if I was blind and did not see this. They did not even ran any test with the card. I contacted support and they are just trying to reffer me to anyone else, except ASUS. I am really tired of this ******, cause support only answer VIA email 1 - 2 times a day, so I would just pay for the repair and forget about ASUS for ever. But there is no repair centre in my country! There is only one actually, but they are not authorised to work with GPU. So when I ask support how can I get my card serviced for paid repair they reffer me to seller. And ofcourse seller can't do any repairs, cause how could they, if even ASUS authorised service can't do repairs to GPU. So i have a perfectly looking 1080ti card, without any bents or scratches, or anything else, and I can't do anything with it. I can only sell it over the internet to some poor guy, who will then curse me and ASUS. But I can't do that, cause instead of ASUS I have a soul and I care about other people. Also a few works about email support - I asked them how can two broken blades of one fan cause the whole unit to fail, especially when the blades broken AFTER the GPU stopped working correctly. Support advised me to do ""independent examination of this equipment and provide its results to us"". Ok and if I do that, what then? You will finally run test on GPU too? No! The answer was - ""If examination will be in your favor, you should write a claim to the Store"". So I spend time and money to make examination of GPU, send results to ASUS and then ASUS gives me the green light to write a claim to seller? Amazing advise, you must have trained him for at least 6 months to provide such support.",english,asus,Eduard,1,2018-11-30T20:58:57.000+00:00,I bought ASUS ROG STRIX 1080ti for…,1

I opened it and it was a different brand of GPU, and upon closer inspection, as the 980Ti was no longer in production, they sent a 1070Ti instead.

"Extremely poor customer service and inadequate repair  I have been having trouble with my laptop now for over 1 month.   About one month ago my laptop just turned off for no reason and wouldn't turn back on.   After calling the technical support they were unable to help me because my laptop was not under warranty. This was extremely frustrating because I had purchased the extended warranty when I purchased my Vivobook laptop. It took several phone calls to explain that I did have extended warranty and needed the laptop repaired desperately. Having purchased the laptop directly from the ASUS online shop it blew my mind that their technical support workers couldn't access the records and see that I had in fact purchased the extended warranty.   After three phone calls the technical support finally recommended I email the ASUS online store asking for my proof of purchase records. Once I was able to show my laptop had an extended warranty they finally started repairing the laptop in the service centre (this took about 4-5 days in which the laptop was just sitting in the repair centre).   I received the laptop from the repair centre about 4 days after it began repair to find the laptop still isn't working properly. The laptop only works when it is on charge. The laptop will charge for the first 30s and then stops and sits on 1%.   This is extremely frustrating having received the laptop back from the ASUS service centre for it to be not properly working. The laptop is only 17 months old and I spent $1000 on it. Definitely not what you would expect for the amount of money you have to pay.   Overall, the technical support team were extremely frustrating and not helpful. The team at the service centre were helpful, however the laptop still isn't working like it should.

"So I have an ASUS laptop, it's about five years old but everything I throw at it, including games, it eats alive. New this laptop in the UK was circa £3000, it's a gaming laptop so it wasn't cheap. You can still buy it on ebay today for about £600.   Suddenly it stopped working and I realised it was a proprietary cable that connects the motherboard to the SATA board that was broken. This cable is worth about £15 including postage but ASUS does not make it anymore even though the very expensive laptop isn't that old. So for the sake of a part worth £15 this expensive laptop is now completely useless to me.  I spoke to ASUS and they were just ignorant and rude throughout. They're attitude was we don't care. They actually told me to see if I could buy this proprietary part on Amazon. Clowns. I asked if I could get it specially made and I'd happily pay extra for that but no, they don't want to help at all. Their attitude stinks.  Absolutely terrible customer service. It's a company that takes your money and lets you rot. I won't be buying another ASUS product again.

"I’ve been an Asus customer for over 10 years, I love their products quality, functionality and design. However, I was let down by the latest machine and their customer service.  Heat The machine processor heats up to uncomfortable levels, reaching 70C degrees when running basic operation ie. Chrome Browser and Outlook email.  Screen The screen packed up 6 months after purchase. No warning, just will not light up and had to connect an external screen to be able to access the machine.  Customer service The lack of customer service is beyond recognition. Failure on multiple levels;  Professionalism: No one owns the problem, it get past to each other and have to start explaining the issues from the beginning. At one of my calls to them they started addressing me as “mate”, as we were sitting in a pub after few drinks.  Transparency: They refused to explain the normal operating temperature of the machine. It took 5 emails to get an answer  Curtesy: Considering they are working with professional companies and customers, it is logical to assume that customers will have sensitive data and rely on their machine to be the main unit. However, they refused to provide a loan machine whilst my machine is with them for repairs. Worst they refused to provide clarity for when the machine will be repaired and sent back, no even an expected repair period. In the 21st century, all mighty Asus cannot figure out when a part can be delivered and fitted to their machine, or they know and they don’t want to tell you. Not sure which one is worst.  This is why I believe Asus don’t care, their warranty guarantee is just to show that have a similar service to other companies.

"If I could give them no stars I would. This is by far THE WORST company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. The pixels went on my Notebook screen about 8 months after the initial purchase. I contacted the customer services team straight away (the number of which was not easy to find) they said my laptop was under warranty and I could get it sent off to be repaired and returned for FREE. Roughly two weeks later I received an email quoting 'customer induced damage' and claiming that I would have to pay nearly £340 to have my laptop repaired and returned. I was absolutely appauled. When I contacted the customer service team they told me I'd have to discuss it with the repair centre. Upon phoning the repair centre I was told that they can only go on past experience of what they think causes specific damage and that I must've forced the lid shut with an object in my laptop (I'm not an idiot!). They claimed that as there was a 'crack' in the screen I must've caused this damage. I was shocked, there was no crack in the screen when I sent it. According to the repair centre a crack in the screen referred to the pixels being broken and if it was a glass screen then there would be a physical crack. I.e. there's no 'crack'. They told me to phone Asus Customer Services as only they would be able to help reduce the cost or repair the notebook for free as they would provide the parts. I was actually told by the repair centre that they've had a few cases where this has happened and Asus have paid out?! Asus Customer services is awful- they are not based in the UK , cannot provide phone numbers for anyone higher up and their grammar/ level of communication is atrocious. When a higher category of customer services were reviewing my case, I could not be informed who they were, I wasn't able to have a telephone number and when I was told I would be contacted, unsurprisingly, no one ever contacted me. Asus have now had my NoteBook since FEBRUARY 2018. I have contacted them over 30 times and they refuse to provide numbers of anyone higher up, respond to emails quickly or efficiently and treat their customers like dirt. I have been very upset as I use this laptop for work. I have recently been made redundant and rely on laptops for job hunting.

"I was stupid enough to buy an ASUS All-in-one desktop computer in February 2017.  In January 2018 it crashed spectacularly.  I contacted ASUS and, after one false start, they sent me instructions about returning it to them for repair. This I duly did.   About three days later, they e mailed to say that the repair had been done and the machine was on its' way back with the couriers, DPD.  Then I was told that the computer had arrived at DPDs' Smethwick depot in the West Midlands and it would be delivered in the next day or two.  It never arrived.  I contacted ASUS Customer Service (after several attempts), the telephone ringing for 20 minutes without answer on at least two occasions. It transpires that their Customer Service is in Bulgaria.  Their staff are obviously trained to delay, obstruct, excuse and ignore BUT not to help their customers.  Eventually and in despair at the total absence of progress, I wrote to ao.com from whom I had bought the computer.  To be fair, they were brilliant. They made more progress in 48 hours than I had in several weeks.  It appeared that the computer had vanished in DPDs' depot and was nowhere to be found.  DPD would not help. They insisted that I had to go via ASUS.   All I got from them was ""we will raise a second level enquiry with DPD. It will take about a week"". It took about two weeks.  Again I asked ao to intervene and they did.   Eventually DPD agreed that the machine was lost and that it should be replaced. However, ASUS then told me that they no longer had any computers of that spec so they would refund my money...ah!  but they would deduct 20% because it was 11 months old.  IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, but that did not count.  It then took nearly seven weeks for them to pay me my refund despite me pointing out to them that an electronic transfer to my Bank takes seconds.  So, this saga that began in January has just been resolved in mid-May.  Be warned you prospective computer buyers. Steer clear of ASUS!!   This is without doubt one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with in my 70 years.

I try to reach ASUS to send it to the factory where it was made to get some repairs for a cost of course. What they mentioned is that they cannot fix it.  The question is: spend so much money for a laptop considered in top 3 and afterwards get terrible service.  I would sew them if I could, though don't have evidence.  The customer service is terrible and I am very disappointed.   Never going for ASUS ever again and don't recommend it to anyone either.

"I've bought many products from ASUS over the years and many of them have had issues.  One of the gaming laptops had severe over-heating issues where it constantly had to shut-down after less than an hour of gaming. So please tell me how this is a ""gaming"" laptop if it can't even play a small game for an hour on minimum graphics? It's all just a gimmick. Not to mention the battery died after a few months and would only work when plugged in directly to the power outlet.  Next, I built my own PC since laptops clearly weren't working, I bought 2 products from ASUS, the motherboard and RAM sticks. Now I'm not sure if it's the 3rd RAM slot on the motherboard or the 3rd RAM stick, but one of them clearly doesn't work as my computer won't boot if one of them is in use. It works fine once I keep that slot/RAM stick clear.  Their support is also non-existent and not to mention I'm upset that they've sided with NVIDIA in anti-competitive behaviour and snubbed AMD and removed all the premium branding on AMD devices to please their allegiance with the former.",english,asus,Stratos,2,2018-09-24T10:28:57.000+00:00,Issues Galore,1

"We purchased an Asus UX310UA laptop for my wife to use for her business. The device is well constructed, although the track-pad could be better, and represented an excellent specification for the price.   Unfortunately, after having the laptop for a couple of months, we realised that the SD Card slot was faulty. The problem that we faced was that the card would physically not fit into the SD Card slot on the device which suggested some sort of manufacturing error.   We contacted the retailer in the first instance (AO) and they directed us to the manufacturer with whom they understood to have a service level agreement which guarantees a 7 day turnaround on repairs, including logistics. I contacted Asus who could not have been more difficult to deal with, here is a summary of the chain of communication.   - In the first instance, they suggested a full software reset of the laptop, which clearly was not necessary and I presume was suggested because they did not take the time to read the problem that I had described.   - On the second attempt at resolution, they informed me that I was using the wrong card and that my laptop does not have an SD card slot (it definitely does!).  - Third time lucky? Nope! Having sent them a photograph of the SD Card slot and the SD card I was using, they simply didn't respond.   - Having not received a response, I chased them up and they simply responded to tell me that the photographs were not attached. Of course they were to the original email, not the chaser.  - Finally, on the fifth attempt, they acknowledged that something didn't look right with the slot and directed me to the repairs process.  So you ask, what's the problem? Well, the problem is that there is no commitment as to when we will get the laptop back, no 7 day turnaround, in fact, no time frame whatsoever. Given the laptop is used daily for my wife's business, this has effectively left us stuck with a faulty laptop as we are unable to return it without knowing how long we will be without it.   If all goes well, you will probably be pleased with your Asus product but if there is a problem, then you may find yourself wishing you had spent your money elsewhere.",english,asus,Phil S,1,2018-01-24T17:08:38.000+00:00,"Faulty laptop, no commitment for turnarounds on repairs.",1

"Asus UK must have the worst technical support I have ever seen. Contacted them ref OLED on their PRIME X299-DELUXE motherboard not displaying anything,and told them I had the latest Bios installed, eventually when they got back to me they suggested installing the latest Bios, did they even read the message? So I rang them with the problem, and after telling them on the phone I had the latest Bios installed, they suggested after a long pause to go on their website and install the latest bio......hello is anyone listening! I gave up realising I was wasting my time with them,  because they seem to think the latest Bios was what you say to customers when you don't have a clue what the initial problem is. Asus as you can see from dozens of other reviews are a complete waste of time, once you buy a product that's it forget any support, I gave them a one star just for eventually answering the phone!  UPDATE ...... Two weeks after I contacted them I received an E-Mail from their so called support team stating "" the OLED on your motherboard is faulty ""    ..................  "" YOU DON'T SAY "" , no mention of giving any help to rectify the problem. How this company is managing to survive is a mystery, if the rest of the company is like their technical support then it's days are number in today's market.

At first they said it was awaiting parts after a month I called them and this is what I was told , After another two weeks they said my unit couldn't be repaired and would issue a buy back of 80% but for my inconvenience they would offer a 100% buy back at this point I just wanted a working laptop asked if it was possible to send me another unit ? To a reply off no we don't have any!! But then offered me a older lesser model nearly 4 years old !!! To my reply of not a chance ! They then stated that they wanted to now give me money back again now at only 80% of what I paid ? So I said I will only accept a newer model then mine or a unit identical to mine considering they had the cheek to offer me a 4 year old machine in which said they could give me they same unit identical to mine as they had sourced one . On waiting again another month and calling again ,as I was expecting it to be shipped out was then told the unit didn't pass there quilty control and had a damaged screen so once again had reverted to the buy back at 80% now at this point I'd had enough and said fine so they sent me forums to fill in and send back via email which I did a month and a half ago and still nothing I keep calling there customer service to complain only to receive emails saying  ""it's with the relivent department "" every time, this all started at the End of June when I sent my unit it we are now in September and nothing has been resolved no money no laptop and not sure what to do or where I stand this company should be banned from trading and selling there Rubbish goods never will I buy asus again and I'll make my mark buy telling everyone I can how crap they are !!!",english,asus,DirtyDozen12,1,2017-10-22T17:59:26.000+00:00,This has got to be the worst company in …,1

We sent the laptop back for repair and it arrived back with a faulty screen and the bezel was not pushed back correctly, we sent photos to ASUS and they advised to RMA the device again. We sent the device to the ASUS repair centre again and it was sent back with a snotty letter advising us to just put up with the problems. We then found out that ASUS were sub contracting the work out in the UK to a company Business Computer Services UK LTD (Cambridge) We contacted them advising them of the problems and questioned their competency to repair the laptop to manufacturers  standards.

"I purchased a notebook from Asus a couple of months ago worth $2500 and paid an additional amount on top of that for an international warranty as I am a frequent traveller.  This week, I left my laptop charger in Japan enroute to Singapore. When I arrived in Singapore (not my home country), I rang the Asus Singapore contact number to find out where I could purchase a replacement Asus laptop charger for my laptop and what the cost would be, thinking it should be a fairly simple process to get this information.  To my horror, I was informed by the customer service rep that he didn't have this information and that he would ring me back. He promised to ring me back by 5pm that day (I had the conversation with him at 10am). I told him it was absolutely necessary for me to obtain a charger that day as the bilk of my work involved working on my laptop.  Needless to say, I did not receive a call back until the next day at 12pm. But the clincher was this - he rang me to say that the Asus service centre in Singapore has refused to provide me with information on whether they had stock of the laptop charger or how much it would cost because I purchased my laptop in Australia and they will only help me if I walk into the Asus service centre.  How absolutely preposterous!! This must be the worst customer service I have received anywhere in the world and with any company. After paying over $2500 for a laptop WITH INTERNATIONATIONAL WARRANTY, I am told they will not answer a simple question as to where I can PURCHASE (I hasn't asked or a free laptop charger) in Singapore.

"I've never in my life taken the time to review a company before. However, the distress this has caused me will never be forgotten and I will simply never buy a product from this company again, but I'd also like to warn others to be careful and think twice. All they are interested in is taking your money.  I bought an Asus Zenbook UX501J laptop in January last year, which is meant to be a high performance and reliable £1100 laptop. I bought it to keep me entertained as I work away all week, isolated with nothing to do at night. For the first 6 months it was fine, but that's the only positive I can give this piece of junk.   From then on I started getting blue screens, which changed each time, and while annoying and inconvenient, due to my circumstances and it being such a hassle to return, I just lived with it. I tried fixing it with formats to no avail. Eventually, and due to it being Christmas, I had free time to get it sent back and fixed. Asus Warranty collected it and repaired it (a hardware fault). Great, but still shouldn't be failing so soon after buying it.   So now it's the New Year and I finally have a working laptop. But then, one month later, and conveniently just out of warranty it turns itself off mid Internet browsing, and that's the last I had out of this £1100!!!! Laptop!! Now comes the 'Customer Service'. I wrote a very long email detailing the history and my disappointment that I'm left with nothing after spending so much money, literally, days after the warranty expired (I didnt even get a full year warranty as I never had a year of use in the first place). However, despite this, I soon found out there was absolutely no way of getting this email to Asus UK. There is no email address anywhere, and the online form they have only allowed a maximum of a few lines to be sent. Best part is, it never worked either, I tried for weeks on multiple different phones, desktops, etc. But I could never get it to submit my complaint! I tried the online chat and tried to get them to address my complaint, however, when I sent through my message, they told me I should ring up as they are the wrong department and there are no email addresses for me to contact.  Eventually I rang the customer service hotline which I didn't like to do, as I wanted a proper response from them. I spoke to a man who wasn't interested in the backstory because it was just out of warranty, and snapped that nothing can be done unless I pay £50 to inspect it. With parts and labour to be added depending on what is wrong.  The sheer bluntness of this experience, with no care that I've had the worst experience I've ever had with a product, didn't sit well with me. And with no way to speak to anybody properly, or even open a line of formal communication with them, I was damned to give them anymore money. I opted to get another company to look at it, whom found out the motherboard has died and that it's hundreds to fix. I don't have the money at the moment so as of writing, I have been without a laptop for 6 months, with absolutely nothing to show for my £1100, except grief that I ever bought it.  I would warn anybody looking to spend a significant amount of money on their products to think twice. If anything goes wrong, you are on your own, a faceless company that isn't interested  with no way to speak to anybody properly.   Anyway, my money is gone and I'm left with nothing but an expensive doorstop. Thanks for nothing.",english,asus,Colin Hird,2,2017-08-20T09:18:12.000+00:00,Worst experience I've ever had,1

The latest coming with two big cracks on either side of the screen with a year old manufactured date.

"Purchased K501UB laptop 17 months ago for £699, laptop gave up after only 14 months. Asus refuse to stand by their product in any way. I have been charged £37.50 +VAT to collect and look at the laptop and now if I want the laptop back to have the repair performed elsewhere I have an additional charge of £45 to pay to have it returned. Including VAT that is £99 to be told that my Laptop needs a new Motherboard. The estimate for the new motherboard? Well that is £758.47! Come on Asus, really!!! UPDATE - 8/7/17 ASUS have agreed to foot the bill and the laptop was returned Monday this week. Disappointed by the communication of letmerepair, numerous emails and phone calls unanswered, laptop just arrived. Worring part was that the estimate the sent gave you 14 days to respond or your laptop would be destroyed. I had no confirmation from letmerepair that they had received contact from ASUS to undertake the work FOC so was worried they had not got word and would destroy the laptop. All worked out well in the end but did have to pick up the phone to ASUS support, online support would not stand by the product where as phoning support got much better response.

Currys took it for repair sent it to ASUS and today i got replay from Currys that ASUS sent them an email regarding my tablet. So basically, they emailed, that customer have caused damage to tablet and it is unrepairable!!!! Even a kid could see there is no visual damage caused by anything that it was production fault!

A definitely no more Asus from now on. Bought a i7 laptop for £600 in Aug 16. Not working in May 17 and Asus repairing claim it is the user causing water damage and the repairing will be outside the warranty. I'm not even arguing if this is really caused by me but the point is it quote for £740 to replace the mother board.

"I purchased the ASUS X550CA on the 29th November 2014 for £300, it was a black Friday sale so they dropped the price by £100. In the first year I had problems which could be fixed over the phone, so this didn't worry me. Second year I didn't use it as much as the first and I had no issues with it. IN December 2016, the internet connection would just drop. Again it was only used about 3/4 times a week so it happening once in a week didn't seem like an issue. IN February 2017 it became annoying as it was constant. I would start my PC and it wouldn't recognise any networks, i would have to keep restarting over and over until it did. Then when I was on the internet It would disconnect. I called at the beginning of April and they sent me some drivers to re-install. I saw that the drivers were not for windows 10!! I called back and i was told that there aren't any specific drivers for windows 10, so I have to use the ones they gave (sorry, I can't remember which windows they were for but definitely NOT windows 10). It didn't fix a thing. Their opening times are ridiculous as it's until 5pm and like most full time working people I do not get home until 5:30ish. And surprise surprise they are not open on the weekends! So again, I had to wait until I could find the time and I rang them again during the end of April 2017. This time I was sent a million and one instructions to reset my PC and some other stuff. It took me about 2 days. SAME PROBLEM. NOTHING FIXED. Google search showed that Asus seems to have this reoccurring issue with their laptops. I called again on the 9th of May and I was told to get it fixed from a local shop or they can have a look at it for £45 to tell me what the problem was.  Absolutely LIVID. I have a HP laptop that is 9 years old! First 5 years was a breeze with it. It has to this day never ever disconnected from the internet. The only issue it has is that the touchpad doesn't work so I need to use an external mouse and it is EXTREMELY slow (should never have upgraded it to windows 10, lol).

"I would rate Asus a fat 0, if possible would go negative 100, their support and customer service is simply terrible, wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.   Bottom line if you buy Asus and anything goes wrong be prepared to suffer and likely never have anything resolved, again this is based in real life experience of over 15 years of dealing with these people. Its a pure waste of time.  Asus has two levels of support, level 1 and level 2, Ive never been able to get any higher because they are just there to ignore or dissuade and lead you to utter frustration. No amount of complaining to customer service helps either,  customer service always sides with supportt, in my experience of being an Asus customer for over 15 years, I could have not used them after a few negative experiences, but this is not always up to me.. sadly.  Level 1 support, is the one everyone reaches at first contact, these people know nothing about any subject, and level 1 is there to dissuade you from going any further by dismissing any issues outright. Just get them to bump you to level 2 support if at all possible.  Level 2 if you ever get there referred by level 1 is a miracle, you stand better chance of getting to level 2 by complaining to customer service or other means. Once in contact with level 2 they often provide bogus solutions (Like Mr Peter S) that have nothing to do with issue if they even bother to help you at all and just ignore your emails altogether, effectively closing the issue as resolved even though its not.  Asus level 2 support also refuse to pass genuine issues to the developers and to headquarters and customer service or complaints department, again play the same despicable tactics of fobbing you off like Mieke van T. recently did.  Asus would do better financially if they did not offer support or customer service or complaints at all, The results would be exactly the same and they wouldn't have the wages expenses...

"An Open Letter to Jerry Shen, CEO of ASUSTeck  Dear Jerry Shen,  As the CEO of ASUSTek, I think it is important that you are aware of how your customer service department is impacting on the reputation of your company. And it isn’t pretty. Consequently, I am copying this letter to the sites listed below in the hopes that ASUS will address my problem and warn others about the product. Receipts of the numerous repairs that had to be done – none of which worked – are also attached below.  Thank-you for your attention to this matter and I look forward to receiving a new computer that works. The following problems are reported below and copies of the work orders follow the list of sites copied: •	On the 23rd of December 2016, I bought an X441U Asus Computer at one of Asus direct distributors in Colombia, the A.D.S.L group. On this computer, I invested COP $1’750.000 – the equivalent to USD $626. •	The day after I bought this computer, it blocked and I had to take it back to the Asus shop on the 26th of December. It was given back to me one day after, formatted. I never actually had the chance to use it “brand new”. •	After the computer was given to me, it started displaying a blue screen and it would block, forcing me to restart it often. This is when I had to take it back to the Asus shop on the 15th of February, 2017. The customer service operators indicated that my computer had an issue with its main board. However, they told me that they had solved it and it wouldn’t fail again. It took them about a week to give the computer back to me. •	The computer was never at its full capacity and kept on displaying a black or blue screen. In April 2017, the computer started shutting down unexpectedly. This happened even when the battery was at its full capacity. I contacted the Asus distributor in Colombia and they were unable to solve my problem.  •	On the 13th of September 2017, my computer was taken again by the Asus distributor in Colombia. It was given back to me almost a month later, arguing that the main board needed to be updated and that the battery slot was missing a piece –this made the computer shut down unexpectedly. This time, the computer was taken to the Asus’ headquarters in Colombia. •	I kept the computer for a few months, however, it never performed at its full capacity. Until the 22nd of March 2018, when I had to take it back to the Asus distributor because it simply wouldn’t turn on.  •	After two days, the distributor told me that this computer had a permanent damage in the main board and there was nothing they could do to fix it. They also told me that my warranty had expired, so I would need to pay for any further service.  •	The distributors gave the computer back to me, arguing that I could never suspend or set my computer in hibernate mode. Because the mainboard was in such a terrible shape that it wouldn’t take it.  •	A week after the computer was given to me, I noticed that the sound had stopped working properly. On the 7th of April 2018, I had to take the computer back to the distributor, which asked me to leave it there for a week, because they didn’t know what to do.  Having said all this, I find that the only solution to end this situation is by having ASUS give me a computer that works properly. I refuse to continue being passive about it –not to call it a scam is to leave it unreported.

At this point, I'm not very confident that I'll even get the laptop back.

"First I must say that I really like ASUS computers and am using one right now. Also the price is often very good compared to other brands, so you get performance at a good price.  Now to the slightly negative experiences I have had with ASUS Zenbooks. The last two Zenbooks I had experienced issues with the charger input. Everything worked fine for about 1 year but after that chargin started to get ""glitchy"" and finally impossible. First time I thought it was my fault and that I should be more careful. I liked the Zenbook otherwise so much that I bought the new model. After a year the same thing started to happen (even though I was careful). This time I sent it back and I was able to receive my money back.  I now have an ASUS computer (instead of Zenbook) so I haven't given up on them. But it seems like it is a know issue and should then be fixed. I hope it is only Zenbooks and that my computer is going to be fine. 3 months so far and working fine.  The fact that I still use ASUS after the issues with charging port shows how much I otherwise like them.",english,asus,Ebenezar64,7,2018-02-05T16:16:00.000+00:00,ASUS user but beware of the Zenbooks charging port issue,3

When I called the customer service, the person in call was very unreliable and unresponsive. I basically have to repeat about my concern as in I talked with some stranger. Furthermore, after I visited the customer service center the person who was in the counter was also not very helpful. They actually just want ask for your concern and leave.

"I bought an ASUS ROG Strix GL553VE in June 2017 for Can$1650.00. After almost 6 months of use, I can say with confidence that I totally regret this purchase. Here is why :  1.	The keyboard layout is non-sensical. There is no Num Lock key indicator that informs the user of the state of the number pads (number input or cursor navigation). So, one never knows if for example a 9 is going to be typed or the cursor is going to move on Page Up. If you type a lot, you likely won’t be able to use this laptop keyboard. I tried for a long while but I had to give up and finally had to buy an external keyboard, which of course totally defeats the purpose of having a portable computer.  2.	The ROG family of laptop from ASUS is supposed to be designed for gamers. So I thought this pricey machine, which has an Intel Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T7100 @ 1.80GHz and a EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Gaming graphics card would easily be able to drive my SAMSUNG SyncMaster 245T at its native resolution (1920x1200) as a secondary monitor. Well, it can’t. Not only the image quality is very bad (color shift, color rings), but the text is smeared out and worst of all, the windows is bigger than the actual monitor screen, so that both the menu (top) and task bars (bottom) are not visible. This is not adjustable from the monitor in HDMI (the only mode available from the ASUS laptop).  3.	ASUS technical assistance for the above problems has been abyssal. All they could come up with was the traditional “Reboot”, “Reload Windows"" and ultimately “Send the machine back""!  4.	Intel technical assistance for the graphic controller was even worst : Not very keen about sending the machine back to ASUS who would have probably send it back to me saying that nothing was wrong with it, I sent all the details to Intel technical assistance hoping they could fix the controller settings/driver. They pretended to study the problem for several weeks, but it finally transpired that they were not doing anything at all, despite the technician talking about a lab studying my screen shots and so on. All they did was telling me to install an updated generic driver whenever one was becoming available (happened twice). They never look specifically at the problem at hand despite pretending to do so, since they finally directed me to their Community asking me the very same info I provided to them when I first contacted them. In other word, they were just buying time, probably hoping for me to forget about the whole issue. When I pressed them, Intel finally acknowledged that their graphic controller was simply unable to drive the secondary monitor at 1920x1200 (while my 10 yo Vista computer was!). After wasting my time for 6 weeks, they found it appropriate, as a final touch, to ask me to fill up their online customer satisfaction survey.   5.	Finally, not so critical but a very noisy cooling fan starts whenever this laptop performs anything more that listing a directory content. If you are in a quiet setting, like a library, an airplane, etc. you will sure attract attention. Reminiscent of a vacuum cleaner noise.  Otherwise, the laptop performs “OK”… You mileage may vary, but honestly, you will probably find the ASUS-Intel combo video set up is just a cruel joke. Buy a simpler rig or a much more powerful machine (i.e. desktop). This is in between, and was a waste of money for me.",english,asus,Pascal R.,1,2018-01-03T23:26:53.000+00:00,ASUS ROG with Intel graphic controller = Waste of money,1

"I purchased an ASUS ROG in Canada prior to moving to Ireland this September. After about three months the charger input jack came loose and migrated into the body of the laptop. I put in a service request and they sent a courier directly to my house, which collected the laptop for repair. They had no problem honouring the Canada warranty even though it was sent to the UK. They replaced two faulty parts, and even pulled out a dent in the top casing and replaced my keyboard (although I'm not sure why, but hey not going to complain). They couriered it back to my door, with absolutely no fuss. I sent the laptop in with the original receipt and warranty card (I always recommend keeping everything when you make large purchases).   The only negative is it took about two weeks to ship/repair as it had to go from Ireland to the UK.

I cannot even believe that this is legal.... the upshot is I have spent now over £200 for a defunct device which managed 2 months of usage.

They are refusing to repair the item, even though it was returned by them to myself still being faulty (not my fault the warranty just ended). Currys are refusing to help so I've contacted Asus..... and they are pointless as well. They basically repeat the same stuff Currys does - that the post repair warranty only covers items repaired. They are somehow deaf to hear my argument which says that the item didn't even charge once after Currys returned it to me, so I took it back to make a proper repair.  I imagine that both companies think that I'm probably some kind of a con-person, who tries to get a new tablet just before warranty expires. Strange though that how on earth I made that fault in the first place? Not saying about the fact that I specifically asked them to offer me any of possible solutions: repair, refund, refund on storecard, replacement etc (whatever suits them). The tablet costed £150 and just last year I purchased two Iphones 6s plus (£700 each) from Currys (plus plenty of other stuff in the past) and they can easily check that I haven't done any previous claims/complaints with them.  So as it seems, both Currys and Asus don't care about genuine complaints and basically force me to take matters further.

"If you are in doubt of ASUS credibility on phones like I was when about the buy it. PLEASE, DO NOT DO IT. It is the worst waste of money ever.

I usually end up getting everything done on my phone while the wheels are still spinning trying to get the laptop to change pages or open a program. Even typing is ridiculous, because its so slow. I can type two sentences and a minute later still waiting for the letters to show up or I'll start rewriting what I wrote because nothings showing on the screen then randomly the characters will show up. I know I type fast, but no other computer or processor in the twenty years I have been typing has ever had a problem keeping up.

"I bought an Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe and 2 months later it got an inkspot in the corner which grew everytime the screen went to sleep and turned back on, eventually taking over the whole screen. So I called ASUS, they said it would be under warranty and it would take 7 days, 10 max, for turn around to get it fixed. I was left without a phone for 2 months and they charged me over $200 to fix a $500 phone because a nix in the bottom of the phone voided my entire warranty. Jump ahead 2 more months and it's inkspotting again. I called them and was basically told that if I sent it in it would be another fee to fix the same issue even though it's their fault. I will never buy another ASUS product or deal with their shoddy nickle and dime repairs and horrible lying customer service agents ever again.",english,asus,Cerra Jewel Hunting,2,2017-09-11T15:44:54.000+00:00,I bought an Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe and 2 …,1
"If there were a way to give them negative stars, I would.  I bought a desktop from Asus less than a year ago.  Within a month it stopped waking up after going to sleep - not a huge deal on its own, but it's really bad for a computer to have to restart like that.  Fast forward 10 months and I have intermittent internet.  My computer frequently freezes and makes a buzzing sound for several seconds at a time.  A few days ago it shut down while I was in the middle of using it for no apparent reason.    I've called Asus multiple times and I've received different advice every single time.  The only thing in common is that they always said to ship it back to them for repairs.  Well, I don't drive and I frequently work from home, that doesn't really work for me.  I asked them every time what they would do about a replacement computer while mine was being repaired and they always said that I would just have to do without.    Asus is little better than a scam.

"I've never in my life taken the time to review a company before. However, the distress this has caused me will never be forgotten and I will simply never buy a product from this company again, but I'd also like to warn others to be careful and think twice. All they are interested in is taking your money.  I bought an Asus Zenbook UX501J laptop in January last year, which is meant to be a high performance and reliable £1100 laptop. I bought it to keep me entertained as I work away all week, isolated with nothing to do at night. For the first 6 months it was fine, but that's the only positive I can give this piece of junk.   From then on I started getting blue screens, which changed each time, and while annoying and inconvenient, due to my circumstances and it being such a hassle to return, I just lived with it. I tried fixing it with formats to no avail. Eventually, and due to it being Christmas, I had free time to get it sent back and fixed. Asus Warranty collected it and repaired it (a hardware fault). Great, but still shouldn't be failing so soon after buying it.   So now it's the New Year and I finally have a working laptop. But then, one month later, and conveniently just out of warranty it turns itself off mid Internet browsing, and that's the last I had out of this £1100!!!! Laptop!! Now comes the 'Customer Service'. I wrote a very long email detailing the history and my disappointment that I'm left with nothing after spending so much money, literally, days after the warranty expired (I didnt even get a full year warranty as I never had a year of use in the first place). However, despite this, I soon found out there was absolutely no way of getting this email to Asus UK. There is no email address anywhere, and the online form they have only allowed a maximum of a few lines to be sent. Best part is, it never worked either, I tried for weeks on multiple different phones, desktops, etc. But I could never get it to submit my complaint! I tried the online chat and tried to get them to address my complaint, however, when I sent through my message, they told me I should ring up as they are the wrong department and there are no email addresses for me to contact.  Eventually I rang the customer service hotline which I don't like to do, as I wanted a proper response from them. I spoke to a man who wasn't interested in the backstory because it was just out of warranty, and snapped that nothing can be done unless I pay £50 to inspect it. With parts and labour to be added depending on what is wrong.  The sheer bluntness of this experience, with no care that I've had the worst experience I've ever had with a product, didn't sit well with me. And with no way to speak to anybody properly, or even open a line of formal communication with them, I was damned to give them anymore money. I opted to get another company to look at it whom found out the motherboard has died and that it's hundreds to fix. I don't have the money at the moment so as of writing, I have been without a laptop for 6 months, with absolutely nothing to show for my £1100, except grief that I ever bought it.  I would warn anybody looking to spend a significant amount of money on their products to think twice. If anything goes wrong, you are on your own, a faceless company that isn't interested with no way to speak to anybody properly.   Anyway, my money is gone and I'm left with nothing but an expensive doorstop. Thanks for nothing.",english,asus,Colin Hird,2,2017-08-31T23:25:22.000+00:00,Worst experience I've ever had,1

"I purchased a X553S laptop/notebook for basic browsing, the first time I used it one of the keys/letters came off.  It has been beset by constant problems ranging from Black Screen, slow loading, buffering, lagging.   The performance has been nothing short of abysmal.  The keyboard is springy and when you actually type anything the letters don't actually show up and are missing and you have to retype or inset letters all over again.  I have checked for add-ons etc. and what is running in task manager etc. but the CPU at all times is through the roof.  It needs charging three to four times a day for basic use.

"Good potential product , terrible BLB and even worst that Asus collaborates with LetMeRepair UK that have such a bad reputation and they proved that to me by sending me a replacement in the form of a PA279Q used monitor instead. First of all I've got my Asus PG279Q computer screen from Aria PC UK and they sent me an open box on the grounds that hey do pixel checks , funny enough the day I've received the unit had several dead/stuck pixels and a considerable amount of backlight bleed.I've decided that is not acceptable so I've asked to have the unit replaced.I was adviced to get in touch with Asus directly , so I did . After several email sent to them with attachments containing the issues I've been advised to fill a RMA form.At the first two attepmts I was refused an RMA because the serial no apparently appeared on their system as the unit has been purchased from abroad ,which I didn't ,so they asked for proof of purchase . I think I had to send up to six emails in different formats with the bill over several days because they could not see the attachments since they only accepted some particular formats or something . Eventually they got the document and accepted the RMA and I was advised I will get a replacement when they have one in stock.After a week or so I've received one email from DPD &amp; LetMeRepair UK that I will receive a replacement shortly. I looked LetMeRepair online to see what they have to do with all this and all the bad feedback about them showed up in my search engine first &amp; I hoped they won't make this harder than it has to be.Today I've received the replacement , a PA279Q yes a PA ... also in a terrible state, please see the pictures.

"I ordered a zenbook laptop online from Asus store about one month  ago, and when it was delivered  by Fedex, it was UNSEALED.   However I ignored it and start to use. But working with it for about 10 days, just drove me crazy.  It doesn't work properly. Its touch pad stops working alot.  Each time I  turn lap top on a message for updating pops up but at the end it shows another message that it cannot be updated for some problems. When running my  codes it stops working many times.  Sometimes its speaker stopped working too and in addition, every time I leave it in sleep mode, it took me about 2 hours to log in again. Actually it prompted that my password was wrong. But after 2 hours of wasting my time with the same password I logged in.   I wanted to return it before its 30 days deadline and for returning  in Fedex they told me that I should pay for its shipping!!!!!!  I paid about $90.   Why????!!!!

"this is weird. i've had asus laptops for years. i'm using one right now that i've had since 2014, and before that i had one from 2010 - 2014. i also have an asus desktop that i've had since 2012.   in every case, my asus has been great, but the reviews here are shockingly low. and to be honest, my laptop that i bought in 2014 did have some problems. there was a soldering problem with the keyboard, where when i'd type sometimes the keys wouldn't click. i returned it (at best buy, which I also reviewed excellently for their help with this) and after trying a second one, eventually settled on a third.   that was a weird problem, and this laptop hasn't been as stellar as my desktop or the laptop I previously had. but still a rock-solid laptop and an easy 4-stars.   however, i can't give 5-stars because my little brother also has an asus and it's very, very disappointing. it crashed at least once a week, sometimes once a day, and we're not sure why. i'm pretty good when it comes to computers and i can't figure this thing out, outside of upgrading it to windows 10 (a fate worse than death, blech).   he still loves his, but recently he wasn't able to play ESO at all because his asus just wouldn't run it. despite having a graphics card, RAM, and a processor that should be able to run that game twice without sweating, he couldn't ever get it going.   so i don't know. i look at these reviews and i wonder, is the asus of the past gone? are they no longer an excellent company? i'll be getting a new laptop soon and i assumed it would be an asus. maybe that's a mistake.   i still love my laptops and desktop from them, so take this as you will.",english,asus,Kim Anola,1,2017-04-20T02:49:07.000+00:00,has ASUS been slipping?,4

"ASUS / ASUStek Product Type : All-in-one PCs Product Model : ET2321IUTH  ASUS All In One ET2321IUTH computer WEB CAM WILL NOT WORK IN SKYPE  I bought an ASUS All In One ET2321IUTH computer from PC World/Currys in August 2015 in the UK and have since found that the webcam does not work in Skype.  I would expect any modern computer to work in Skype wouldn't you? But if you look on the internet, there are several threads where people have complained that their ASUS computer web cams do not work in Skype and no-one seems to do anything about this.  Had I read these numerous threads before buying an ASUS computer, I would never have bought it.  I have been in contact with ASUS UK support about this problem, who were incredibly UNHELPFUL and have just referred me to Skype. I had dozens of email exchanges with them, even writing to their CEO, but all to no avail.  I was even in contact with ASUS USA support and I was disconnected several times. I asked to speak to a manager, but Dwayne, Supervisor, Technical Support, seemed to be unable locate anyone.  They suggested a factory reinstall, which I had already done. He also suggested a number of other ""solutions"", which included using the Skype app in Windows 8.1, which has been discontinued in Windows 10!  Dwayne then told me to call ASUS UK support, as he appeared to run out of options!  Back to ASUS UK:  One of ASUS UK's excuses was:  ""Just to clarify, the issue was caused by an update to the skype application. They have changed the codecs they use, causing a possible incompatibility. We are not able to fix this, as this was initiated by Skype. As of right now, the only way to resolve the issue, is for Skype to update their application or for users with non working webcam to revert to an older version of skype.""  This is a ridiculous excuse, as I have five other HP laptops, a Packard Bell All In One computer and even a very old Dell laptop and ALL of their webcams work in Skype.  How come my brand new £600 All In One ASUS computer does not?   It also proves that this is a KNOWN ISSUE, so why was I not told this at the point of sale?  By the way, I also tried the older versions of Skype, which is on their archive and that did not work either!  The web cam itself is some generic product with no name. It doesn't even have ASUS drivers. It has generic Microsoft drivers dating back to 2006 - and those are the latest! No wonder it doesn't work in the latest version of Skype.  This nonsense has been going on now since I bought the computer in August from Currys/PC World and the webcam STILL doesn't work in Skype. As I write this, it is the end of October 2015.  I have to tell you that I am extremely upset and disappointed about the poor support and lack of concern by ASUS technical support.  After all, I think it is completely reasonable to expect a £600 (UKP) computer bought two months ago to work with one of the most popular and well used apps on the planet!  I also think it is ridiculous that I should be told to go and speak to Skype about this.  Furthermore, when I bought the computer, no-one told me that the webcam would not work in Skype.  As of now, ASUS have washed their hands of the problem and just told me to take the matter up with Currys PC World and Skype. This was one of their parting comments:  ""As mentioned previously, our R&amp;D department is responsible for the driver releases and the development of our own drivers and BIOS updates. I am unable to answer your questions on your previous emails regarding the drivers updates with every OS updated release by Microsoft. As mentioned previously, we can only highlight and pass on your complaint. We do not have any insight of how and when it will be handled, nor can we advise when updated drivers will be released and if they will be released. As the support team, we try to assist customers to the best of our ability with the resources which have been made available. We are unable to provide any details regarding other department within the company.""  I wonder if ASUS realise how inadequate these statements are when you make them to a customer? In a nutshell, it means that in their computers with generic no name webcams, they really have no idea when, if ever, Microsoft or anyone else for that matter will make drivers to make them work.  The takeaway from this is to ask Microsoft if the webcam in the ASUS computer that you plan to buy, will actually work in Skype or not, because it seems to me that ASUS have no idea if it will and if it does not work, when or if it will.  What an awful experience this has been and how much time has been wasted on emails, telephone calls, factory reinstalls, rolling back to Windows 8.1 THREE TIMES and all for nothing!  Needless to say, this will be the last ASUS computer I ever buy.  I should also point out that Skype have been equally disinterested in finding a solution, as I have been having protracted correspondence with them too. Having written that, it's not really up to them to make drivers for ASUS webcams to work is it?",english,asus,John,4,2015-11-20T14:05:08.000+00:00,ASUS All In One ET2321IUTH computer web cam will not work in Skype!,1

"I had a ZenFone 2 phone for about a month before I started using the 2nd SIM slot for my work number and this is where things went downhill. The phone would drop signal on the 2nd SIM at random causing me to miss or get cut off in the middle of calls. I contacted ASUS UK to fix it on warranty to be told this phone 'was not purchased in the UK' and therefore they will do nothing about it. Of course I protested and produced my amazon email receipt as proof I indeed purchased it here to be told '...we cannot accept the document attached as proof of purchase as this is classed as an editable format ...websites such as Amazon .. offer a platform for end users and retailers to trade, however these are not seen as official traders...If not purchased directly from Amazon themselves, we are unable to accept the claim you have raised with us for repair as the first point of purchase is not confirmed to be an official trader of ASUS products'. I have owned so many ASUS products and would have until this point recommended them to anyone, but a company that does not stand behind its products and would ask me to pay to fix a manufacturing fault on a brand new phone is not a company I ever want to be associated with.

"Bought an ASUS tablet at Christmas time just for light use. 6 months of light use later it stopped responding to touch. Sent it back in under their warranty after they made me order a VAT invoice as nothing I printed myself from the online retailer I purchased the item from was good enough. No one ever updated me how it was going I had to constantly chase them. Parts came to fix it but didn't fix it so more had to be ordered. ASUS UK don't know what the repair centre is doing and ASUS customer services telephone staff will tell you to 'send an email' if you aren't happy with their answers and Facebook seems to be run by yet another group of staff who don't communicate with each other. Finally send my item back and it seems fixed but they have damaged the casing quite badly trying to get it apart and just sent it back to me that way. I am now waiting to find out what they propose to do about that. They can take up to 48 hours to 'escalate' the issue, whatever that means, and I should just sit tight with my damaged item they kept for 3 weeks to fix what should have been a simple remove faulty part fit new issue. Would never have another ASUS product if they paid me.  Further to this review, they took the item back on 30/07 to repair what they damaged. They claimed to have a video of the 'unboxing' which would show them cutting the cable ties DPD use to seal the box and the condition of the item as it left the box. I was getting to the point of small claims so I made them aware of this and asked to also review the video as I wouldn't like to find I was mistaken (was pretty sure I wasn't) and have inadvertently wasted the court's time. They were unable to produce the video. They claim to have a firm process of taking one of these videos for every unit but for some reason never took one for mine. That seems pretty darn convenient that they should have some evidence to show the scratches but in my case all they have is a paper check in record that says the scratches were there. How much easier is it to make a paper record say whatever you want it to say at any point in time than it is to produce a video record of the same after the fact? I'll have to let you readers be the judge of that. So they then agreed to put it right under 'goodwill' and I agreed to this purely as I want the item back in the same pristine condition it left me in so that I can sell it for as much as possible. It left me on 30/07/15. It is still to date with them. They (letmerepair in this case) claim to have ordered the required parts in a timely fashion but claim that ASUS can't supply them until minimum 28/08. They then need 2-3 days to replace what appears to me to be cosmetic cases which should just come apart and fasten back on. They will then ship it back. Bare in mind that this is a 7-8 month old item that will now have spent 2 months of that ownership with letmerepair via ASUS. ASUS just pass the buck from one department to the next. The phone people don't know anything and don't really care. The emails you get from the email team are often barely legible and not relevant to the issue/question. The Facebook team passes the buck to the email team and if you complain they will sometimes reference a second line team but you can't speak to them, you must wait for them to contact you. They don't have any sort of president you can write to or if they do the phone people 'don't know that ifnoration'. The whole company seems like a poorly run waste of time and I recently steered my mother away from an ASUS that looked like a good deal off the back of this experience and she bought a HP instead. As an aside I bought a used Microsoft Surface (the original one with windows 8.1 ARM that everyone sneers at) and it's head and shoulders better than the ASUS. I love it to bits. The ASUS will be flogged on for whatever I can get for it, that is if I ever see it again in the state I first sent it off in, which is starting to look doubtful. I'm half hoping they can't fix it or get told they'll never get the parts and they have to refund me. I'd rather have the money than the tablet at this point anyway.

"I've owned three ASUS laptops and recommended them to numerous others. After needing to use the ASUS warranty I'm embarrassed to have ever recommended them and will never use them again. Half of the hinge on my new ASUS 550CA  simply dropped out.  There was no accidental damage or misuse.  Unfortunately that happened whilst I was in Australia and ASUS insisted that the unit be posted by me back to the UK for repair.   That wasn't an option as the item was absolutely critical to my work and communication and as it still worked I had no option but to continue to use it.  Inevitably the screen became damaged but still worked. Immediately upon my return the laptop failed entirely, EXCEPT for the screen. I returned it to the retailer John Lewis who were extremely unhelpful but who did advise me that ANY physical damage to a laptop will, without exception, be deemed Accidental Damage by ASUS. Three and a half weeks after the item was returned John Lewis have finally contacted me.  ASUS has advised that the hard drive and keypad module have failed and may be replaced under warranty however they are adamant that the hinge failure was not a manufacturing defect and they are not prepared to repair unless I pay £300 plus.  Repair may take another two weeks or so.

"I won an Asus Ultra Zen note book, at a promotion in Covent Garden in London in August 2012. You would think great, but after three months I had to send the machine back under warranty. The solution was replacing the hard drive, no attempt to retrieve the data was made, so everything on board was lost. _ _ _ _ _ it Now 18 months later I switch it off and I cannot switch it on again. Even though Asus advertise this model has 24 months warranty this is not true for European users in Europe the warranty is only 12 months.

When i pointed out they had 3 days to find it and that i wasn't willing to wait another 2 days, phone goes dead.  Rings back, guy seems a bit more helpful, but ended up with pretty much the same conclusion and it will take an indefinite amount of time to find it, again i pointed out this was not good enough, phone goes dead. 3rd guy gets it both barrels but i do get a number for their repair center.

"On 6/16/16 I purchased an Asus X99-DELUXE II motherboard for a new pc build. Everything worked great for about 2 months. The motherboard and processor both inexplicably failed and after troubleshooting, RMA of both products was the route I took. Intel's process was quite simple. Either you ship out the processor, and wait 8-12 bus days for the replacement or place a deposit down and they'll next day it. In my case it was out of stock, so they had me purchase one on Newegg and sent me a refund for what I paid. ASUS however, is the polar opposite. Or so they led me to believe. The initial rep was fairly rude, and immediately resorted to other equipment being the issue, although I had already tried spare equipment and it still didn't work. After finally convincing him to RMA the board, the options were ship it to them wait up to 12 bus days as well, or next day it the same as Intel. But how it was explained to me, I had to put a deposit down, and if my board wasn't actually defective upon testing i would get charged the amount and not refunded. So $419 originally, then $419 Deposit, and if it's not defective, we come to a grand total of $838 dollars for possession of 1 board. I asked to speak to a supervisor. Ask him what he can do to rectify the problem. His response was he'd put in a request to re-check inventory to try to get it to me faster. Ultimately likely adding 2 bus days to an already long 12. Declined my request to purchase the board on Newegg which had them in Stock, a refund me like Intel did.  While on Hold, the add for their warranty process claimed they provide the ""piece of mind a customer deserves"". That's laughable at best, considering when I asked the supervisor what he thought pieces of mind was, he said ""well piece of mind can be explained in several different ways."" Seems straightforward to me. I declined to RMA the board, and spent extra money on an MSI board which works swimmingly. And I've got a $419 Asus paper weight for my troubles. Don't even get me started on the $1500 ROG laptop sitting on my desk with a non functional charger that asus won't replace either.  In summation, my experience with Asus is horrible, and I won't be purchasing anything from them any time soon, if ever.",english,asus,Matthew T.

I contacted asus, and told them the circumstances, and could not find original receipt, however it was registered with asus. They point blank refuse to fix the laptop, although I sent them screenshots of my over 20registered  asus computers. They have not acknowledged any goodwill for the loyalty I have given to the brand. I have shown them evidence of where the laptop was purchased, so I assume they have copy of transactions  on their systems. It has made me angry that a company as large as asus, should effectively ignore a legitimate request to fix a product of theirs that is faulty from a sealed new DOA. I'm hoping that by making this complaint publicly, will give me a better outcome, as I have exhausted anymore communication with asus customer support.

"My older phone died whilst travelling abroad, so I purchased an ""Asus Zenfone 2"" (ZE551ML) in Singapore to replace it, I knew that it came with a local warranty only, but believed (naively) that it would last at least 1yr.  I genuinely couldn't fault the phone considering the specs for the money... First phone with 4GB of RAM, Powerful Intel Processor, Lot's of storage with expandable memory, and decent everything else; Granted there's better ""Flagship"" phones, but considering it's around a third of the cost of a top Samsung etc, it was good value for money. I happily raved to everyone I knew about how good a phone it was for the money, until...  One day, randomly whilst charging, it literally just turned off, and never turned back on? It wasn't over charged, around 90%, and was using the official Asus provided Charging plug and cable. I contacted customer support who asked me to follow their instructions to perform a restart/cold boot, which I did to no avail, so they told me to fill in a claim form to get it replaced.  I did so, only to eventually get a response stating that as it was purchased in Singapore it only had a local warranty and that they would not therefore be helping. I knew this from the start that it was a local warranty, but assumed (wrongly) that since the device was clearly a faulty unit (which after further research seems to be a fairly common fault), and happened less than 10 months from new, they would at least attempt to repair it for me seeing as other companies have done so in the past.  Didn't even get an option to pay for the service or what they recommend to do to solve it, I just got a standardised email stating the above.  I therefore do NOT recommend purchasing a product from Asus, not even based on the (Very) localised warranties, but the shoddy product quality and the after sales service.

"I have never bought Asus before and never will again, wish I had seen peoples reviews before purchasing.  The screen developed a bleed (Asus X555LA) and after having no joy from John Lewis I decided to contact Asus.  Firstly they have no repair centre, you cannot take your laptop into a shop to be looked at. I phoned their contact centre to be told the only way to return a laptop is to book a courier. I told them I needed my laptop for my business and needed a replacement, they said there was nothing I could do, the only way to get the laptop examined was to book a courier.   After my experience with John Lewis I told them I needed someone to inspect it with my present to see if the damage was covered by warranty as I believed it was. They said that was not possible. Any repair could take up to 6 weeks too. Anyone who knows laptops knows replacing a screen is a 30min job tops.  I then complained, there complaints department then proceeded to tell me that only a courier could be booked and if it was found to be a user issue the cost would be £45 each was for the courier plus VAT and a new screen would be 300 Euros!  I then told them this was unacceptable so asked them for the product number of the screen and I would do it myself. They would not tell me the product number for the screen and then proceeded to tell my this screen was only available in the USA or Germany. Really....this screen must be really special.....but it's not, it's rubbish and cheap, like the laptop.  They actually sent me a link to the wrong screen. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I removed the keyboard and screen. The laptop is cheaply made, plastic for the most part with cheap parts. I found the product number which they could have easily told me instead of telling me a flat out lie. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with, almost £400 to replace a screen in a laptop, disgraceful. They have no concept of customer service and the parts used are poor as the screen to buy including delivery is £50.00 and funnily enough is held by companies in the UK, who'll give you a 2 year guarantee on the screen. It'll take me 15 min to replace it and save me £350.

Asus MX299Q So first of all i will review the product quickly and say when it was working it was decent. They brag about how small the bezel is but yet the screen has a permanent black border around 1cm thick.   Ok so now down to my problems with the company/service. My Asus monitor was a month or 2 old when the issue occurred. I had Screen tear permanently down the right side of my screen to which i contacted Asus.  After playing ping pong with emails back and forth i finally got a pick up and replacement arranged. Can you imagine spending £350 on a monitor and it breaking after a month of use and then have to buy another one to use whilst waiting on the company to pull their finger out.  So after a solid month of fuss emailing back and forth they bring a replacement to my work as stated. I hand over my old monitor (which was in pristine condition) I receive the replacement in which i observe. To my disbelief i have been sent a model which has obviously been repaired and the outer shell/stand is completely scratched. All in all from the moment this monitor broke up until now i have had nothing but a sour taste in my mouth about this company.

"I own a VERY expensive laptop from Asus which I love, however I required greater capacity for the two SSD drives so I wanted to upgrade. Now I have an extensive background in IT but I left the profession around 4 years ago so my knowledge is not current. So I contacted Asus Technical Support to find out about my upgrade options and what I'd need, I quickly came to realise they don't know the first thing about their products, they really don't!   They first claimed that my laptop didn't come with SSD drives, but it does, two of them. Then they claimed the laptop came with internal 2.5inch SSD drives, I was suspicious so I did some research and eventually I just opened up the laptop to take a look, what I saw I'd never seen before, they weren't 2.5inch SSD drives. After a bit of research I found out they are a new technology called M.2 SSD drives, but there are two types SATA and PCIe, which I have wasn't clear and right now information online is conflicting and unclear. So I pointed out to them they weren't 2.5inch drives but M.2 drives and I asked several questions about that, they didn't know most of the answers but did confirm that the hard drives were M.2 PCIe. Now given they've got everything wrong about this laptop so far right from the start, and their answers felt more like guessing, I did even more digging around and finally found out they are M.2 SATA III drives not M.2 PCIe drives as ASUS claimed, so on every count each time I contacted ASUS 'Technical Support' the information they gave me was wrong!   They do not know their products, the information they provide cannot be trusted, these M.2 drives are expensive and they could have cost me a small fortune had I purchased the wrong drives based on their repeatedly incorrect information. Additionally I discovered that they haven't done any testing of their system so cannot provide any help with upgrade options in any case.  I once asked them for the motherboard manual so I could learn more about this system and work out my own upgrade options, they told me they could not release it due to concerns about their competitors, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard and is completely baseless.  All in all their 'Technical Support' is of absolutely no use whatsoever and I don't even know why they bother having it.

"I recently bought two X-99 Deluxe ASUS motherboards. One build was successful. However the other would not post. Several calls to ASUS support resulted in erroneous suggestions, i.e. they blamed the graphics card, power supply, memory, CPU. I replaced the power supply and did the voltage tests on all channels, confirmed that the memory was OK, tried a new graphics card to no avail. ASUS sent me a replacement motherboard which cost me $32.00 to send the original back. This did not resolve the problem.  The second one was also DOA   I contacted Intel who said it might be the CPU but it was not conclusive. However they promised to send me another CPU under the condition that ASUS would send me another motherboard to make sure both were not cross damaging each other. I contacted ASUS again and a supervisor agreed to send me another one. This agreement occurred November 26, 2014. ASUS promised to send me an email that day with an RMA and when the information was completed and ASUS received the email back they would send me another motherboard.  Not having received any email from ASUS, I called in on the morning of December 1, 2014.  I was advised that there was no record of them having agreed to send me another motherboard, no record of the telephone discussion or individuals, John and Zak, I had talked with November 26, 2014. Instead they stated a call had been documented on November 27, (Thanksgiving Day when ASUS was closed) which made no mention of any of our agreement and that they would not send me the promised replacement motherboard as Intel had requested and was agreed to by ASUS.   Not having received the email and with the morning technician denying everything that had been agreed to, I contacted ASUS on the evening of December 1, 2014 again and was put on hold.  After 15 minutes a female came online and asked me if ASUS could call me back.  (I confirmed that ASUS had received the return motherboard as they requested.)  I was promised a return call that same day and that they were trying to locate a motherboard in the warehouse.  This is at odds with what John told me on November 26th.  - his story was he walked into the repair section right next door to the support room and said they had a new one in their inventory.     I have spent countless wasted hours replacing components which were not the problem at the suggestion of ASUS and now I have a reneging of an agreement. This will cost me countless more hours in an effort to resolve.   Two years ago I had a similar problem with an ASUS Rampage IV motherboard. The memory slots were defective. To make a long story short, I ultimately had to write to the CEO in Taiwan to get any customer service. Here I go again.   In conclusion, I can't afford to do business with ASUS and will purchase from another manufacturer in future. Poor quality control on the ASUS motherboards and a bureaucratic, apparently incompetent and questionable ethics customer support entity is not worth the wasted time and money.     UPDATE:   Last night I spent another 2 hours on the telephone with one of ASUS support reps.  Although they noted that the previous support reps promised me a 2nd replacement motherboard because of DOA problems they changed their story and refused to do so.  The bottom line is they now have officially reneged on the promise by a two support staff and a supervisor on November 26, 2014 and will NOT send me another motherboard as promised.     As a matter of interest, I purchased an EVGA motherboard today and installed the same, exact components as I did on the ASUS motherboard.  The difference is the EVGA powered up right out of the box but the ASUS was DOA twice.   And ASUS refuses to send me the promised replacement motherboard???  ASUS has cost me thousands in lost time and effort. I paid good money for their product.  I have wasted two months fighting them and I'm stuck with a dud motherboard.  Learn from my experience and avoid ASUS.       We are now in legal territory as it is called ""breach of agreement"".  In my State verbal agreements are binding.  Update #2 My motherboard was dead (DOA) and now ASUS technical support have asked me to not contact them again.  I now have involved an attorney.  He is in turn is filing complaints to Attorney Generals in Nevada and California for an investigation into ASUS business practices i.e. refusal to honor their warranty.",english,asus,L J,2,2014-12-03T12:03:01.000+00:00,"ASUS Mothboards - low quality, incompetent and unethical support staff",1

"Useless phone support  My brand new VivoPC won't output audio through the built in speakers, and after many attempts to solve the problem myself, I throw in the towerl and contact asus phone support.  First of all you can barely hear the menu on the phone because the quality is so bad, and the actual support is worse.  Their support workers apparently have zero technical training or knowledge of their products.  No attempts to solve the problem were made. The staff only suggested re-installing the audio and chipset drivers (which I had already tried), and then call them again if that didn't fix it.  The staff asked my exactly zero questions regarding my system beyond the model number.  So I call gain and no further attempts are made to find the problem, no questions, nothing. The staff just says the next step is to do an RMA (tanks for nothing Thomas).  This is without a doubt the most terrible support I have ever received.  If you have any problems with an asus product in Denmark, you can expect exactly zero support from asus.",english,asus,Allan,2,2014-10-15T15:03:28.000+00:00,Useless support,1
"I asked customer service, what the average power consumption on Asus DSL-N66U was. They would however not tell me, due to ""competion""-reasons.  This is a ridiculous thing trying to keep as a secret, since it is very easy to measure after you have bought it.  I'm trying to get the info through customer forums instead. Some review sites post the average power consumption during their tests, but I haven't found any info on DSL-N66U yet.",english,asus,Niels,1,2014-07-14T19:04:23.000+00:00,Customer service would not say average power consumption on ASUS DSL-N66U,1
"ASUS has an excellent product portfolio. Therefore, it is unfortunate that post-sale service is so poor that it would be wise to refrain from buying their stuff.  And fortunately there are other - more serious - players in the market, offering equipment at least as good a quality.  We bought a motherboard, which after a time turned out to have a small but annoying defect. One of the contacts in the processor socket had it after a month's time to let go its grip on its pin causing ‘blue screens’. At first we thought the problem was caused by a defective processor. We had it changed at found out it was not. The computer was running fine, but only for about 3 weeks.  Then the processor should be removed at reinstalled in its socket. When that was done, it was fine again - for 3 weeks! In the long run this was too annoying and therefore it was fortunate that we still had full year’s warranty on the motherboard. We decided to make use of that.  Meanwhile the retailer from which we had bought the motherboard had closed his store. Therefore we turned ourselves directly to the Asus Company via their support team. Unfortunately, the team was unable to take care of the matter. Instead the team referred us to the main European wholesaler – to the German firm ‘Devil’. Unfortunately Devil could not help us either. Devil had a policy of never dealing with retail customers. They only dealt with resellers. They acknowledged our predicament, but the best advice Devil was able to give us was to try to persuade a random, but friendly and helpful retailer to overtake the responsibility from the closed retailer! This advice was of course less than useful :-( Well ... back to ASUS 'support team. Too bad! Again we were referred to Devil. ASUS themselves could not do anything at all. It was VERY, VERY unfortunate for us that our retailer had ceased to exist, but we had to understand that this simply was a case of FORCE MAJEURE and hence it should be obvious that ASUS was chess mate and out of the game! The higher powers had spoken! ASUS’ sorrow was deep: 'Dear valued customer ASUS', this was really, really sad for us, but there was nothing, nothing ASUS could do to help us now! Then followed a correspondence of about 10 to 15 mails each way. We tried hard to convince ASUS’ support team that it ought not to be our problem that one of their (!) dealers had turned the key. It was ASUS and not the retailer that had issued the guarantee on the motherboard. ASUS Support Team – on their side - tried their best to convince us that it obviously could not help when our (!) distributor had ceased to exist. Finally, finally we succeeded in getting a tiny breach in the team's barricade. For a reasonable fee (around 50 US $) ASUS would - exceptionally - open to the possibility that we could send the defective board for examination at ASUS Nordic in Sweden. However, the support was warning us: As the defect typically appeared approximately 3 weeks after the processor was inserted into the socket it was highly unlikely that the technicians would hold sufficient patience to observe the fault. Most likely the outcome of the inconvenience on our part would be that the defective board would be returned to us and that the 50 $ would be lost!  The ASUS support team was right. We had to give up. ASUS had won the battle.  And yet ... We, the Network Group, will obviously never buy products from ASUS again. And the sum dedicated to IT hardware on our budget is not small. When we search the Internet for reviews on ASUS it is evident that we are not the only ones to think that ASUS support have much to be desired. These many others customers are not likely to buy from ASUS again either. Moreover it might be possible that you - dear reader – when you read this story would consider other options and perhaps prefer to buy from other companies with better service. SAMSUNG could be a case in point. This company quickly and efficiently repaired a defective monitor - purchased from the exact same dealer - without dodging at all. The Network Group would of course prefer to buy their stuff.    Perhaps in the long run a better service would be a more profitable strategy for ASUS. We hope so!",english,asus,Olaf Tehrani,4,2014-02-13T19:39:40.000+00:00,Amazingly poor service!,1
